</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Snow, snow, snow!</p>

<p class='c004'>Below and above—here, there, and everywhere!
Up to his knees in snow, Pall à Seyru struggled
across the wind-swept heights. The snow whirled down in
great downy flakes, making it impossible to see more than
a few yards ahead. Stooping, with heavy, weary steps, he
tramped on, an empty sack slung across his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had come from the trading station, and was on his
way home to his own hut in the mountains; the store-keeper
had refused to grant him further credit, and in consequence,
he had chosen to return by this lonely track across the hills,
where he was sure of meeting no one on his way. It was
hard to come home at Christmas-time with empty hands to
empty pots and hungry mouths.</p>

<p class='c004'>His only comfort was the snow. It fell so thickly as to
shut out all around, and seemed to numb even the poor
peasant’s despair within the dismal prison of his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now and again he heard a sound—the whir and cackle of
ptarmigan flying overhead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly a gust of wind sent the snow flying over the
ground. Another—and then gust followed gust, growing
at last to a veritable hurricane, that swept the very snow-clouds
from the sky. And as if by magic, a vast plain of
snow lay open to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>All Hofsfjordur was suddenly visible. Pall turned, and
saw the last of the clouds sweep down into the dark blue-green
of the sea. To the south-east, the peaks of the Hof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Mountains rose out of the water, and over the eastern
landscape towered a long range of rocky mountains that
gradually merged into the great south-western plateau.
His eye rested for a moment on the vicarage farm of Hof—a
few straggling buildings clinging to the mountain-side,
among which the black church itself loomed out, right at
the mouth of the fjord. The houses of the trading station
he could not see; they lay beyond, on the northern shore
of the fjord, safely sheltered behind the rocky walls of the
islets that offered such fine harbourage—to any ship that
managed to reach so far.</p>

<p class='c004'>The parish itself lay between him and the Hof Mountains.
A valley two miles farther up was divided into two narrow
dales by the Borgasfjall, a steep and rocky height. The
rivulets from the two valleys—now but streaks of smooth
ice—met lower down, making part of the valley into a peninsula.
The southern stream was named Hofsa, and its
valley Hofsardalur; the northernmost Borgara, and its valley
Borgardalur; but the rivulets, from their confluence to
the outflow into Hofsfjordur, still went by the name of
Borgara, and the broad valley was called Borgardalur.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the north, on the farther side of a narrow valley,
likewise belonging to the parish, were the faint outlines of
broad, slowly rising hills—the Dark Mountains. The ridge
where Pall now stood was Borgarhals, and ran for a long
way between Borgardalur and Nordurdalen, in the heart of
the mountains, leading to the little glen where his cottage
lay, close to a brook, and not far from the lake. There
were trout in the water there, to be taken by net in summer,
and in winter by fishing with lines through holes in the ice.
Wild geese, swans, and ducks were there in plenty, from
early spring to late autumn.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Pall’s thoughts had wandered far from all this,
settling, as did his glance, on a row of stately gables that
rose above a low hill in the centre of the peninsula, formed
by the waters of Borgara and Hofsa.</p>

<p class='c004'>From three of the chimneys a kindly smoke ascended.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The storm had abated, and folk were beginning to move
about here and there among the outbuildings round the
large walled farmyard. Already flocks of sheep were on
their way to the winter pasture at the foot of the hills,
where some dwarfed growth was still to be found.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was Borg, the home of Ørlygur the Rich, as he
was called. It was by no means uncommon for folk to
speak of him as “the King,” for he ruled over scores of
servants, and owned hundreds of cattle and horses and
thousands of sheep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Pall’s cheeks flushed with a happy thought.
It had crossed his mind that he might call at Borg. All
knew that Ørlygur the Rich never sent a poor man empty
away. But then he realized that today was not the first
time the thought had come to him. No, better to give it
up; he had turned for help to Borg too many times before;
he could not well ask again.</p>

<p class='c004'>With bowed head, and face grey as before, he dragged
himself along the almost impassable track; he was exhausted;
his limbs seemed heavy as if in chains.</p>

<p class='c004'>From early morning to about ten o’clock, while the storm
raged, the farm hands and servants of Borg gathered in
the women’s hall upstairs. The men had come from their
quarters, and sat about on the beds waiting for the storm
to abate before starting out to their work. The cowman
alone was forced to brave the elements and tend his cattle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had opened the door to his own room. He sat
with his two-year-old son Ketill on his knees, and talked
quietly with his men, exchanging views, or giving them
advice about the work of the place. He always treated
them as his equals. The men sat with their breakfast-plates
on their knees, eating as they talked. Some of the womenfolk
went to and fro with food or heavy outdoor clothing;
others were darning socks or mending shoes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr, who was nearing his fourteenth year, sat in his
father’s room, on the edge of the bed, facing Ørlygur. It
was in his mind that things were beginning to be like they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>had been before his mother’s death, two years ago. He sat
with his hands on his knees, swinging his legs by way of
accompaniment to his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never before had he missed his mother so sorely as this
morning, when every one else seemed to have forgotten her;
never before had he felt her loss so keenly. He sighed,
checked the swinging of his legs, and sat motionless for a
while. Tears rose to his eyes. He felt he must go out, or
he would be crying openly in a minute, and disturb the
comfort of the rest. For a moment he sat pondering where
to go, then he remembered that the cowman would by now
have finished work in the shed, and taking down an old
violin from a rack, he left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reaching the cowshed, he sat down in his accustomed
place, on a board between two empty chests, and commenced
tuning his instrument. It was an old thing that
had been in the family for generations, but no one could
remember having heard it played. Then, seven years before,
Ormarr had been taught the rudiments of music by a
wandering fiddler, an adventurous soul, who tramped the
country with his fiddle slung over his shoulder in a calfskin
bag. Since then, Ormarr had given all his spare time
to the music.</p>

<p class='c004'>His father had marked with grief how this one interest
had gradually swallowed up all else; the boy cared nothing
for the management of the estate, or indeed for any other
work. Possibly it was this which had led Ørlygur, in spite
of the doctor’s advice, to wish for another son. And his
wife had sacrificed her life in giving him what he wished.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hard and self-willed as he was in many ways, Ørlygur
had yet a profound belief in the right of every human being
to determine his own life, to follow his own nature and
develop his gifts as long as it involved no actual harm to
others. And he made no attempt to coerce the boy; Ormarr
had his way.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>About ten o’clock, when the snow had ceased, Ormarr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>slung his gun across his shoulder and walked off toward
Borgarhals to shoot ptarmigan.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the way, he met Einar à Gili, a troublesome fellow,
who, in defiance of the general feeling, had so little respect
for the uncrowned king of Borg that he had several times
thrashed his son Ormarr without the slightest provocation.
It was the more unpardonable, since Einar was about ten
years older, and strong as a giant. And now, at sight of
him, Ormarr’s fingers fumbled in passionate helplessness at
the trigger of his gun.</p>

<p class='c004'>Einar hailed him, to all appearance innocent as could
be. “Hey, Ormarr, out shooting? Let’s go together?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had no desire to go out shooting with Einar,
but was curious to know why the other had suggested it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we can see who’s the best shot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This was irresistible. Einar was a proverbially bad shot
with a gun, and Ormarr knew it. He made no protest, and
they went on together.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every time he fired, Ormarr brought down two or three
birds. Einar got at the most one bird at a shot, and often
sent the birds fluttering away with broken wings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, Einar picked up all the birds that fell, and
stuffed them into his own bag. Ormarr demanded his share.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you’ve no bag, and there’s no sense wasting time
tying your birds together at every shot. Wait till we’ve
done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had his suspicions, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a while they came to a good-sized rock, with two
paths round. Ormarr knew that the paths to the south
was the longer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s go round and meet on the other side. I’ll go
this way,” he said, taking the northern path. And Einar
agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they met, neither had any more birds to show.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you fired, I heard you,” said Einar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I missed,” said Ormarr shortly. Einar laughed, but
he took no notice.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Look, there’s one sitting on that rock,” said Ormarr
suddenly, pointing to a boulder some hundred yards away.
“I’ll take him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No hurry,” said Einar; “I’ll bag that one myself.
We needn’t go on any longer—I’m going home now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How many have we got?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, twenty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good, then give me mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, yes—next time we meet! I’m off. My love to the
cattle at home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Somewhat to his disappointment, Ormarr did not seem
to be greatly annoyed, but merely walked off, calling quietly
over his shoulder: “Mind you don’t miss that bird, Mr.
Clever-with-your-gun.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Einar turned round angrily. “Don’t shout like that—you’ll
scare it away. That’s my twenty-first.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. It’s too frightened of you to move. Go and
see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Einar took careful aim—his hand shook a little, but only
because he was inwardly chuckling over the trick he had
played Ormarr, and the thought of telling what he had done.
Though, indeed, he might get little credit for it all; people
were rather apt to side with the lordly folk from Borg.
Still, it was good to have fooled that brat Ormarr again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bird was sitting close on the rock. Einar fired, and,
raising his gun, saw that the bird was still in the same
position. Seeing no feathers fly, he thought he must have
missed, and loaded again. Then creeping cautiously forward,
he rested his gun on a stone, and fired again. The
ptarmigan did not move. Einar felt sure his shot must
have taken effect. He went right up to it. The bird was
dead enough, but what was more, it was cold. And lifting
it, he saw a piece of paper tied to one of its legs, with a
few words in pencil. “Clever shot, aren’t you? Thanks
for a pleasant day’s sport.—Ormarr.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Curse the little jackanapes!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Einar never told any one after all how he had scored off
Ormarr that day.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Ormarr hurried along up hill and down, firing and reloading
rapidly, scarcely seeming to take aim at all, but
never missing his bird. His narrow sunburnt face was
flushed with exertion, and drops of perspiration trickled
down from his forehead. His eyes searched eagerly about
for game, and in a very short time he had a bag of twenty-seven.
Then suddenly, coming round the corner of a rock,
he stood face to face with Pall à Seyru. Pall tried to avoid
him, but Ormarr called him back. He sat down, wiped the
perspiration from his face, and smiled as Pall came up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Puh—I’m warm enough, for all it’s fifteen degrees of
frost. You look half frozen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Pall muttered something, and tried to hide his empty
sack, which had the effect of drawing Ormarr’s attention to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that—going back home with an empty bag?
Won’t Bjarni let you have things any more?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m in debt there already. And I couldn’t promise to
pay before next autumn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But at Christmas-time—and you’re not a rich man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That makes but little difference in his books.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ho—who says that—you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Twas Bjarni said so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you had to go and ask him—beg of him—like
that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our cow didn’t calve, and we’ve no milk. And there’s
no food in the place beyond.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“H’m. What were you going this way round for?
’Tisn’t any short way home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I didn’t want to meet anyone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And going back empty-handed? Why didn’t you come
to us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been a burden to many this long time—to your
folk more than any. And I’ll not ask for help from the
parish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Something in the man’s face made Ormarr catch his
breath. The blood left his cheeks, and in a hushed voice
he asked:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“You mean—you’d....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Pall nodded. “Yes. There’s times when it seems better
than living on this way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pall&nbsp;... here, take these birds—just from me. And
come home and talk to father. You must. He’ll be just
as glad to do anything as you could be for it. As for
Bjarni, he’s a cur. You can tell him so from me next time
you see him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Pall was silenced, and tears rose to his eyes. Ormarr
understood, and said no more. They divided the birds into
two lots, though Ormarr would gladly have carried the
whole, and in silence they started off down the slope.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr slept in a bed next to his father’s. It had been
his mother’s bed. When the light was put out that night,
Ormarr had not yet found courage to tell what he had
been thinking of since his meeting with Pall that day.
Nor did he know what had passed between his father and
Pall.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later, perceiving that his father was still
awake, he managed to whisper, softly and unsteadily:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was as if Ørlygur had been waiting for this. He rose,
and seated himself at the boy’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Twas well you met Pall this morning, lad. His wife
and two little children were waiting for him to come home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words gave Ormarr the courage he had lacked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Father, may I give him Blesa? His cow won’t calve
for six weeks, and they’ve no milk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve promised Pall to send him Skjalda, and a few
loads of hay the first fine day the roads are passable. And
I am going to take little Gudrun to live here—they’ve
enough to do as it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr’s heart was full of thankfulness to his father for
his kindness to Pall. But he was shy of speaking; words
might say less than he meant. And there must be no misunderstanding
between his father and himself—this thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>was always in Ormarr’s mind, for he loved his father deeply.
Now in the darkness of the room, he could hardly distinguish
his features, but in his mind’s eye he saw him clearly,
sitting there on the bedside. He knew every line in the
calm, composed face, finely framed in the dark hair and
brown beard. Often he had been told that there was not
a handsomer man to be found than his father. He had the
physique of an athlete, and Ormarr knew his every movement
and attitude. He strove now to breathe all his love
towards the loved figure, vaguely seen in reality, yet clear
as ever to his mind. He felt that his father could not fail
to perceive the mute expression of his loving gratitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while both were silent. Then Ørlygur rose, and
smoothing his son’s hair, he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know, Ormarr, that all I possess will in time belong
to you and your brother. Then you will be able to give
away more than trifles. At present, you have little to use
in charity, but what you have, you may do with as you please.
Remember that it is our duty to help those who are poorer
wherever we can. And when you hear of any one that needs
a helping hand, always come to me. Wealth is not lost by
charity. And now good-night—it is time we were asleep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went back to his bed, and a moment after, spoke
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr, you remember how generous your mother
always was. You seem to grow more like her every day.
I think she would have been very happy tonight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr burst into tears, hiding his face in the pillow
to make no sound. And after a little while, he fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he awoke next morning, he felt for the first time
since his mother’s death as if she were invisibly present
among them—as a link between his father and himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he was filled with a proud sense of having entered
into a secret covenant with his father; it gave him a feeling
of manhood, of responsibility.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Bjarni Jonsson, the trader, and Daniel Sveisson,
the parish priest,—Sera Daniel, as he was called,—sat
drinking in Bjarni Jonsson’s front parlour.
They were seated by the window, looking out over the fjord.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun was setting, and the shadow of the house was
flung far out over the smooth sea. The smoke from the chimney
had already reached the rocky haunt of the eider duck.
The cliff was the home of immense flocks of many-coloured
birds, for it was spring, and the breeding season was at its
height. Numbers of gorgeous drakes were swimming round
the rock, and amongst them a few plump and comely eider
duck, taking an hour’s rest from their duties before sunset,
leaving the nest and eggs to the care of the father birds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel enjoyed the view, for he was looking out over
his property. The eider-duck cliffs, even those farther
out, were by ancient custom regarded as belonging to the
living. And they brought him in a very nice little sum.</p>

<p class='c004'>He puffed away at his long pipe in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni noticed his contented air, and was not pleased.
Surely it would be more reasonable that the revenue from
the eider-duck cliffs should come to him, Bjarni, as owner of
the shore lands. But priests were all alike, a greedy lot!
For ages past they had been petted and spoiled with all
sorts of unjust privileges and unreasonable perquisites. And
what did they do for it all? Nothing in the least degree
useful, nor ever had—unless it were something useful to
grow fat themselves in a comfortable cure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such was Bjarni’s train of thought. And he meant it
all quite earnestly. But he said nothing, for, outwardly,
he and Sera Daniel were the best of friends—drank their
grog together, and played cards in all good fellowship. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the moment, they were only waiting for the doctor to come
and take a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>No, in his inmost heart Bjarni detested the priest; the
portly figure of the man was a continual eyesore to him.
Sera Daniel was a man of imposing presence, there was
dignity and calm authority in his carriage and bearing, and
Bjarni, having no such attributes himself, found herein
further cause for jealousy.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would be hard to find a less imposing specimen of the
human male than Bjarni Jonsson, trader, of Hofsfjordur.
Outwardly, he resembled more an ill-nourished errand boy
than anything else. His face was grey and angular, the
top of his head was covered with a growth of colourless
hair, and his pale blue eyes were as a rule void of expression,
for the reason that he was in constant fear of
betraying his ever-present jealousy of every one and everything
round him. And the struggle had marked his face,
his eyes, every movement of his puny, stunted body, with
a stamp of servile cunning. His clothes hung about him
like the rags of a scarecrow in the field, the draggled
moustache that hid most of his mouth added to the general
impression of meanness and insincerity.</p>

<p class='c004'>At a first glance, Sera Daniel presented a complete contrast.</p>

<p class='c004'>His burly, well-fed body seemed to exhale an atmosphere
of cordiality——an ecclesiastical cheerfulness which gave his
whole bearing something of the stamp of the prelate. His
fair hair carefully brushed back from the broad, arched
forehead, the blue, beaming eyes, the frank expression of
his clean-shaven face, which, however, never for a moment
relapsed from the bright, superior, yet mild professional
mask of dignity, of healthy godliness attained through
inward strife and by the grace of Heaven; the placid, yet
telling gestures of his somewhat large, plump hands; the
sonorous voice with its echo of sanctity; and last, not least,
his faultless black attire—in short, his whole outward appearance
seemed to combine human forbearance and lofty
understanding with the rare power of living a full and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>yet exemplary life, kindly chastening himself as well as
others—all the qualities that go to the making of a true
servant of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the simple, canny folk among whom he lived, and
from whom he himself was sprung, had not been long in
penetrating beneath these externals. They realized that he
played his part well, and with a suitable mask, which they
tolerated, even respecting him for the same—at any rate,
in his presence, or when young people were about. But
the elders among themselves were not afraid of unmasking
Sera Daniel with a sly wink, as it were, in a manner of
which he would certainly not have approved, nor found
consistent with the respect due to their spiritual guide.</p>

<p class='c004'>Men played their parts well in the parish of Hofsfjordur.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in the opinion of his parishioners, Sera Daniel was
not the only one who played a part at variance with the
character behind the mask, though Sera Daniel himself
might have believed so.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was one family, or more exactly, a single figure,
that did not fit in with the cast of the local comedy. A
keen observer could not have failed to notice that the life of
the community centred round this one man: a dominant figure
among the rest, who knew how to shape their views
according to his will. And he was a source of much annoyance
to the actors proper, more especially those who had
cast themselves for leading rôles. That man was Ørlygur
à Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was in his forty-second year. From early
youth he had been the natural leader among his fellows;
first and foremost, of course, as only son and heir to Borg,
but also by virtue of his personality, which was excellently
suited to bear the rank and wealth and responsibility inherited
from his forebears, who had, as far back as the
memory of man, been the self-appointed and generally respected
leaders of the community.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg, apart from being the greatest landowner
in the district, was also chairman of the local council, and
led the singing in church—in short, all that an Icelander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>combining wealth with intellect and personality could attain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover—and this was perhaps the corner-stone in the
edifice of his absolute authority—he was a conscientious adviser,
an untiring and disinterested helper of the poor, and
an experienced and successful, albeit unlicensed, veterinary
surgeon. In this last capacity he was consulted not only
by the district, but also by many from other counties, who
were glad of his unfeed advice and skilful aid.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was generally recognized that Ørlygur à Borg was ever
ready to serve and assist any one, however humble, provided
they accepted him as a ruler. He never tolerated any attempt
to place others on a footing of equality with himself,
or any violation of his privileges, however slight. To those
who submitted to his sway, he was a mild and gracious
god; to those who forgot the deference he demanded, he was
a merciless tyrant, swooping down on them in defiance of all
generally accepted notions of justice—though he would forget
and forgive readily enough when it was over.</p>

<p class='c004'>The peasants did not mind this. To them, Ørlygur à Borg
was a kind of human Providence—no less inevitable, and
probably more pleasant, than the divine. They knew, of
course, that there was a King who ruled over all, including
the King of Borg. But they were nevertheless inclined
to place both on the same level. In the event of conflict
arising, doubtless Ørlygur à Borg would be a match for the
other—even to gaining for himself the armlet of sovereign
power, as Halldor Snorrason had done in the fight with
Harold Hardrada. Ørlygur was equal to that at least.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their faith in him amounted almost to a religion. They
felt themselves, under his protection, secure and well provided
for.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some few there were, however, who did not approve
of the unlimited power generally conceded to Ørlygur à
Borg, and disliked what they considered his unjustifiable assumption
of superiority. This spring, there were at least
three such discontented souls within the parish. Two of them
we have met already—Sera Daniel and the trader, drinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>their grog in the parlour looking over the sea. And the
third of the rebels was the doctor, whom they were expecting
to join them in a hand at cards.</p>

<p class='c004'>The priest and the trader, when alone together, spoke but
little. They had no interests in common. Their intellectual
sphere was very limited, and both had the same characteristic
of the narrow-minded: concentrating every atom of thought
and will each on his own well-being. Consequently, all talk
between the two was obviously insincere; so much so, that
even these two not very sensitive beings realized the fact,
and instinctively shrank from any intimacy of conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>On this occasion, as ill-luck would have it, the doctor
kept them waiting longer than usual, and Bjarni, as host,
could not well sit all the time without a word. At last,
by way of saying something, he asked how the wool was
getting on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dry and packed three days ago,” answered Sera Daniel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni’s eyes flashed, and a smile flickered for a moment
over his wooden face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel read that smile, and marked the scorn of
it. But as the scorn, he knew, applied no less to the smiler
than to himself he refrained, on principle, from taking
offence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni looked him straight in the face, and their eyes
met. Then suddenly both realized that this innocent and
haphazard attempt at casual conversation had opened up
common ground between them, an unexpected community
of interest where each had only thought to find the
altogether unwished-for company of the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni did not quite know how to improve the opportunity
at first. He decided on a gambit of innocent
raillery.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, we’re ready to weigh it now, I suppose&nbsp;... that
is, of course....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel looked searchingly at him, unwilling as yet
to take any definite step himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you paying this season?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“Sixty-five for best white, forty-two for black and
mixed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel glanced at him with a curious smile. “Is
that—ah—the ordinary price, or what you are paying
Ørlygur à Borg?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The trader’s face flushed violently; the hand holding the
glass trembled a little. Without waiting for an answer,
Sera Daniel made another shot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or perhaps you are thinking of paying the same price
to all—for once?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni eyed him awhile in silence. He seemed to be
turning over something in his mind. The priest felt the
glance, and knew what lay behind it, but evinced no discomfiture.
On the contrary, he met the trader’s eyes with
a smile of irritating calm.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last Bjarni spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he said slowly, “if you can let me have your
wool tomorrow morning.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>That same night Ormarr sat on the slope of the hill
looking down to Hofsa—just above the spot where the wool
from Borg was washed every spring. He was keeping
watch over the clip. Large quantities were already dry
and stowed in bags; the grassy slopes were dotted with little
white piles of that which had still to be spread, waiting till
the morning sun had drawn the dew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Silently, filled with emotion, Ormarr gazed at the beauty
and peace of the spring night. The sky was clear and blue,
and bright as day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Below him flowed the crystal rivulets, and farther off,
above green mountain slopes veiled in the glistening web
of dew, rose stark grey cliffs, furrowed by glimmering
waters, higher up again, the luminous white of the snow
peaks, tinted all the night through with the gold of dancing
sun rays.</p>

<p class='c004'>From his childhood Ormarr had claimed the privilege of
keeping guard during the spring nights. In the earlier part
of the season, he took his post on the freshly growing pasture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>lands, keeping the sheep and horses from straying in to
nibble off the first blades of the young grass. Later, when
the sheep were shorn and driven up to the mountains, he
mounted guard over the wool, keeping a keen look-out for
prowling vagabonds, and covering up the heaps with tarpaulin
in case of sudden rain.</p>

<p class='c004'>To him, the vigils of these quiet nights were as hours
of devotion. During the lonely watches, he bared his soul
in worship of the majesty of nature, free of the restraint
he always felt in the presence of others. He drank in the
fresh night air, with its sweetness of spring, like a precious
draught. And at times, the depth of his feeling brought
great tears to his eyes. Alone, he could allow himself to
some extent thus to give way to emotion, yet even then not
without a certain sense of shame.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tonight he was sadder than ever. It would be fine tomorrow,
the last of the wool would dry during the day,
in time to be fetched away before evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>That meant it was his last night’s watch this spring.</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes took leave of the wild duck swimming in the
stream near their nests, that he had cared for and protected;
several times he had waded out to see how they fared. He
looked the hillside up and down, bidding good-bye to the
buttercups and dandelions—every morning he had watched
their opening, a solitary witness, as they unfolded at the
gracious bidding of the sun. He noted, too, the great
clusters of tiny-flowered forget-me-nots that grew everywhere
around.</p>

<p class='c004'>At five o’clock he rose to go. From one of the chimneys
smoke was already rising, thin and clear as from a censer;
old Ossa had hung the big kettle over the fire for early
coffee. A big plate of new bread would be waiting for him,
with butter, meat, cheese, and a steaming cup of coffee—a
delicious meal.</p>

<p class='c004'>From force of habit he glanced round before moving off;
counted the chimneys from which smoke was rising, and
looked about for any other signs of life. Then suddenly he
realized that something unusual was going on. With trembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>hands he adjusted the telescope he always carried, and
looked towards the spot.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later he lowered the glass and stared in bewilderment
towards the fjord. In a flash he realized what
was happening, and set off home at full speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Heedless of Ossa and the meal she had already waiting
for him, he dashed up to his father’s room, not even stopping,
as was his wont, to caress the fair curly head of tiny Gudrun,
the three-year-old daughter of Pall à Seyru, whom Ørlygur
had adopted. Ormarr loved the child.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not stop till he reached his father’s bed. When
Ørlygur opened his eyes, he saw Ormarr standing before him,
very pale, and breathless with his speed. The sight startled
even the King of Borg out of his habitual calm; he sat up
with a start. Realizing instinctively that something was
wrong, he reached out for his clothes at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, my son?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Father&nbsp;... Sera Daniel&nbsp;... carting his wool in already
to the station....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was already getting into his clothes. He stopped
motionless for a second; then a faint smile passed over his
face, and he seemed to be thinking. In less than a minute
he had made up his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The horses!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr did not wait for any further order. He hurried
out of the room, snatched up a bridle, and ran out calling:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gryla, Køput, Kondut!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Barking and delighted, the farm dogs clustered round him,
and followed him out into the paddock, where he caught
his father’s horse and vaulted into the saddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ten minutes later, forty horses were stamping and neighing
ready for work. Swiftly they were brought round,
the pack-saddle put on, and loaded up with the finished
wool.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had overheard his father’s brief, sharp orders to
the foreman, a man he could trust. He had kept close at
hand all the time, listening eagerly to what was said. At
last, when all was ready for the start, he looked up earnestly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Father—may I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg looked at his son in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You? Nay, lad, I’m afraid that would hardly do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But his voice was not so decided, harsh almost, as it
was wont to be when he refused a request. He even glanced
inquiringly, as it were, at the foreman, who smiled back
merrily in return. That seemed to settle it. Ormarr’s eyes
were bright with anticipation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur laid one hand on his son’s shoulder—not patting
his head or cheek as he generally did—and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. You can do the talking. You heard what is to
be said and done—you are sure you understand?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr did not give himself time to answer. But his
leap into the saddle was enough; evidently he had grasped
the spirit of his father’s commands.</p>

<p class='c004'>They did not take the usual route to the trading station;
anything moving along that road would be visible from below
for the greater part of the way. And they were to
come unexpectedly. Therefore they took the road across
Borgarhals and Nordurdal, so as to reach the station before
any knew of their coming.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>It was the unwritten law of the district that no wool
should be brought to the station before the King of Borg
had sent in his. The custom dated back further than any could
remember, it was part of the traditional precedence generally
conceded to the masters of Borg. At first, it had sprung
from a natural desire among the people to show their respect
for their chieftain and benefactor. Then, when it had
grown to be a time-honoured custom, the men of Borg had
taken care to have it maintained, regarding any violation
as a personal affront, a challenge—and none had ever known
such challenge to remain unpunished.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was, moreover, another custom in connection with
the sales of wool—to wit, that Ørlygur à Borg fixed his own
price for his, while the others who had wool to sell had to be
satisfied with what the trader chose to pay them. Ørlygur
took no heed of ruling market prices, but based his figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>on the prices he had to pay during the past year for goods
he himself had bought from the trader.</p>

<p class='c004'>No one grumbled at the arrangement. Ørlygur always
paid cash for what he ordered, while every one else found
it necessary to take goods on credit; all had an account,
great or small, with Bjarni, and were in consequence dependent
on his good-will. They knew, that in the event of
Bjarni’s good-will failing, there was always Ørlygur, ever
ready to help whoever asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Truth to tell, Bjarni, the trader, was not a little nervous
when Sera Daniel arrived with his wool early in the morning.
He did his best, however, to conceal his uneasiness, but the
false jocularity with which he strove to hide it was belied
by the anxious glances wherewith he scanned every now and
then the road from Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>The weighing in was done in the big warehouse. Sera
Daniel was smiling and confident as usual, though his eyes
showed signs of having slept ill the night before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Sera Daniel,” said Bjarni, who was watching the
weighing with mock earnestness, “this is a bold stroke of
yours indeed.” He glanced hurriedly in the direction of
Borg as he spoke. “Frankly I was not at all sure that you
would have ventured, when it came to the point. Anyhow,
I fancy this marks the end of ‘the King’s’ supremacy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor came up, yawning, and rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aha—this looks nice,” he observed. And then, referring
to Bjarni’s last remark, he went on: “And it’s high
time we did start acting for ourselves. Rebellion, eh? I
tell you what, I’ll stand drinks all round when you’ve
finished here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was great commotion at the station; folk hung
about in crowds outside the stockroom. A few only dared
to enter; the rest preferred to wait and see what happened.
They were not without a certain satisfaction at the act of
rebellion, albeit aware that it was their duty to feel indignant.
There was a general atmosphere of excitement—what
would happen next?</p>

<p class='c004'>“And this year the price of wool is the same to all,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Bjarni exultantly to the doctor. “If he doesn’t care to
deal with me, he can go to Jon Borgari.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor laughed loudly, and Sera Daniel smiled approval.
Jon Borgari was a man of sixty, who had set up
on his own account in a small way, some five years back.
On payment of fifty Kroner, he had acquired a licence to
trade. His store was a mean little place, his whole stock-in-trade
hardly amounted to more than one of Ørlygur’s ordinary
purchases from Bjarni. He had found it impossible to
do any considerable business, as the peasants were all in
debt to Bjarni already, and could not transfer their custom
elsewhere. Jon was considerably older than Bjarni, but the
latter’s business was of longer standing. Bjarni had moved
to Hofsfjordur twelve years before, and partly, at least, by
his industry and smartness, he had compelled an old-established
house in the place, a branch of a foreign firm, to close
down. This he could never have done had it not been for the
patronage of Ørlygur à Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was commonly supposed that Jon Borgari had saved
a good sum in his time—and the idea was further supported
by his recent marriage to a maiden of eighteen, who had
accepted him in preference to many eager suitors of the
younger generation. But no one ever dreamed of considering
Jon Borgari as a possible “purveyor to the King.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni’s warehousemen were busy weighing in the priest’s
consignment. There was still no sign of life on the road
from Borg. And gradually even Bjarni himself began to
forget his fears.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly the blow fell. Ormarr with his five men,
and the laden horses, came galloping up: Ørlygur à Borg had
sent his wool.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni was struck with amazement; for a moment he
could not grasp the situation. Sera Daniel retired prudently
to the back of the room. The doctor joined him, with an
expression of pleasant anticipation on his puffy face. This
was going to be amusing. And, fortunately, he himself had
nothing to do with the affair.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the first shock had passed off, Bjarni realized with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>a feeling of relief that Ørlygur himself had stayed at home.
To the onlooker this was a wonder in itself. Never before
had Ørlygur à Borg sent in his wool without accompanying
it in person.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment all sorts of wild conjectures passed through
Bjarni’s brain. And then—he committed the fatal error
of coming to the conclusion which best suited himself;
Ørlygur must have stayed away in order to avoid being
present at his own defeat, in the setting aside of ancient
custom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr did not dismount. He rode straight up to the
trader, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father has given orders that his wool is to be weighed
in at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He spoke without the slightest trace of emotion; as if
it were a matter of course that the trader should stop the
weighing of any one else’s wool and attend to Ørlygur’s
forthwith.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni again indulged in an erroneous inference: Ørlygur
à Borg had stayed away because he feared his demands
might be refused. And if “the King” himself thought that
possible—why, then, it could be done!</p>

<p class='c004'>A wave of joy swept over Bjarni. He felt as if he had
already won a decisive battle against heavy odds. And his
reply was given in a tone more overbearing than usual—though
he regretted it the moment he had spoken.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can’t very well stop weighing in this lot now. What
do you say, Sera Daniel?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel said nothing at all. His friend Bjarni would
have to carry the matter through without assistance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni turned to Ormarr once more—the boy was still in
the saddle—and adopting a fatherly tone, went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it won’t take very long, you know. If you start
unloading the horses now, and get the bales undone, while
we’re finishing this, there won’t be much time lost.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But before any one could say more, a new development
occurred. Ørlygur à Borg, on his snorting, fiery mount,
Sleipnir, dashed into the stockroom.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>His entry came like a thunder-clap. The onlookers, who
had kept their distance up to now, drew closer in, holding
their breath. No one, not even Ørlygur’s own men, with
the exception of Ormarr, had expected this.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni, Sera Daniel, and the doctor greeted him in servile
fashion; he answered with an impatient gesture, as of a
sovereign in ungracious mood towards importunate underlings.
Then riding up to Ormarr, he asked quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are weighing in Sera Daniel’s wool.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has Bjarni refused to take over mine at once?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. He asked us to unload and wait.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. We will take it back to Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, having given his orders, Ørlygur rode up to Bjarni,
pressing him so close that the foam from his horse bespattered
the trader, forcing him to retreat step by step.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now mark you this, Bjarni Jonsson. You can hire
horses yourself to fetch that wool from Borg. But do not
come until you are prepared to pay a heavy price. I warn
you, my wool this year will not be cheap.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, without a word of farewell, he turned his back on
the speechless and astonished trio, and with a cheery smile
to the crowd, rode homeward, followed by his men.</p>

<p class='c004'>That day messengers were sent out from Borg to all the
farmers round, to say that Ørlygur à Borg was willing to buy
wool for cash, at the same prices as offered by the trader.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next morning, he sent off one of his men with a letter and
a saddle-horse to Jon Borgari. Jon read the letter, mounted
at once, and rode back to Borg, where he was closeted with
Ørlygur for some time. When he left the place, he looked
as if ten years had fallen from his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmers understood that Ørlygur’s offer to buy their
wool for cash was equivalent to a command—they must
choose between him and the trader. And they did not hesitate
a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur paid them in gold and silver. Then, with his
help, they wrote out the lists of the goods they required, the
lists being subsequently handed to Jon Borgari. Jon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>now Ørlygur’s ally, and in a very short time his unpretending
little store was threatening the trade of Bjarni Jonsson’s
own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni Jonsson’s trick had recoiled upon himself. He got
Sera Daniel’s wool—but not a pound from any one beside.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>One burning hot afternoon, late in the summer,
Ormarr was sitting up on the edge of a high
ridge of Borgarfjall, to the west of Borg. A
great flock of sheep grazed on the plateau below.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr, as shepherd, found his task light. It was just
after lambing-time, and for the first two or three days the
sheep had been difficult to handle. Full of anxiety, and
bleating piteously, they rushed about in all directions, vainly
seeking their offspring. Now, however, they had more or
less accustomed themselves to the new state of things, and
kept fairly well together, so that Ormarr was free to devote
most of his time to his favourite pursuits: playing the
violin, and dreaming.</p>

<p class='c004'>He made a curious picture, this fourteen-year-old peasant
lad, as he sat there, clad in rough homespun, his clothes
fitting clumsily, and hiding the lithe beauty of his frame.
The clear-cut face, the strong chin resting on the violin, and
the lean hand with its supple fingers running over the strings,
contrasted strangely with the everyday coat, darned and
patched in many places.</p>

<p class='c004'>Often he fell into a reverie, his dark eyes gazing on the
distant mountains, the fingers relaxing, and the slender
brown hand with the bow resting on his knee. The face,
too thin for a boy of his age, bore a grave and thoughtful
expression, with a touch of melancholy. The black masses
of curling, unruly hair, and the faint coppery tinge in the
skin, suggested Celtic descent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet despite the trace of something foreign in his appearance,
he was at heart a true child of his country. The wistful,
dreamy thoughts that burned in his dark, passionate
eyes, betrayed that rich and abundant imagination peculiar
to the sons of Iceland, fostered by the great solitude and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>desolate yet fertile grandeur of the land itself. So deeply
is the sense of that grandeur rooted in their hearts, that even
those who have roamed the world over, and lived most of
their lives in milder and richer climes, will yet declare that
Iceland is the most beautiful of all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another typical trait in Ormarr’s nature was the melancholy
that consumed his soul—a product of youthful self-absorption
without the corresponding experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>His descent from the ancient and noble race of Borg
was apparent in his chariness of words, in his credulity,—it
was a thing inconceivable, that he or any of his should tell
a falsehood,—in his self-reliance, and strong belief that he
was in the right, as long as he followed the dictates of his
own conscience. Young as he was, every look, every feature,
betrayed the born chieftain in him.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was evident most of all in his music—which consisted
mainly of dreams and fantasies he had himself composed.
From the first day he had learned to hold the instrument, he
had thrown into his music a burning interest and an overwhelming
love. It gave him the only possible outlet for the
longing that filled him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Loneliness and despair sobbed in the sweet and passionate
strains; the strings vibrated with a deep desire, that yet had
no conscious aim, but the sound brought relief, though never
satisfying to the full.</p>

<p class='c004'>His playing revealed his soul as a wanderer in the wilderness—as
a giant whose strength is doomed to slumber under
the weight of unbreakable shackles; it showed that, to him,
life was a slow, consuming pain, the purpose of which he
could not grasp; that he was born with a wealth of power,
yet found no single thing to which he could devote it. Here
he was, heir to the estate, and yet—perhaps for that very
reason—born in bondage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Despite his youth, Ormarr was alive to the danger of his
changing moods, which, as he often thought, bordered on insanity.
Proud as he was of being heir to Borg, he nevertheless
felt a smouldering hatred of his heritage, since it fettered
him from birth. With all these longings in his soul, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>was conscious of being himself part and parcel of Borg;
something told him that here, and here alone, was the soil
in which his personality and varying moods could grow into
one harmonious and united whole. He had only to follow
in the steps of his fathers. But this, again, seemed too easy
a solution of the riddle of life—he preferred a struggle to
the death. It was as if his descent, and his natural prospects,
excluded him from all the adventures he longed for;
the part for which he seemed cast was beneath the level of
his strength and ability.</p>

<p class='c004'>But he realized that any outward expression of such
thoughts would compromise him, and bring disgrace upon
his family: he must conceal them, hide them in silence, never
breathe a word of it all to any other. Only in his music,
where he could speak without betraying himself by words,
could he venture to ease his heart of its burden.</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt like a galley slave, chained to the oar for life, without
hope of escape. The idea of rebellion, of emancipation,
had never crossed his mind. Had any one suggested such a
thing, he would have risen up in arms against it at once,
for, in spite of all, he felt himself so at one with his race that
to desert it thus would be nothing less than to betray
himself.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>That same afternoon an unexpected event took place at
Borg. The Vicar, Sera Daniel, accompanied by Bjarni
Jonsson, came to call.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg was resting on his bed, which in the daytime
was covered, like a couch, with a many-coloured rug,
when news was brought him of the visit. The girl informed
him that she had asked the visitors into the big hall. Ørlygur
smiled when he heard their names. He had just returned
from a sale of driftwood, held at the instance of one of the
farmers whose lands ran down to the shore, and who yearly
gathered in large stocks of washed-up timber, which was
subsequently sold, either privately or by auction. He was
tired, and felt too comfortable where he was to care about
moving.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Let them come in here if they have anything to say,” he
told the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men exchanged glances when the message was
brought them. Each found a certain satisfaction in witnessing
the humiliation of the other, which helped him to bear his
own. Nevertheless, on entering Ørlygur’s room, both were
visibly embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur himself did nothing to set them at their ease.
Without rising, he took their proffered hands, answered their
greetings with a murmur of something inaudible, and indicated
that they might be seated.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was but a single chair in the room, placed between
the two beds. Sera Daniel would willingly have left it to
Bjarni—though he considered it due to himself and his
superior social position to take it in order not to be too close
to his host. Bjarni, however, had a similar disinclination,
and forestalled his companion by taking a seat at once on the
edge of the bed, well pleased at having attained his end, while
seeming to act from sheer natural modesty.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while no one spoke. Ørlygur stretched himself, and
smiled faintly, awaiting the explanation of the visit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel cleared his throat for an introduction he had
prepared beforehand. But he got no further than a slight
cough. And, looking at Bjarni, he perceived that the latter
was in a like predicament, his usually grey face turning a
fiery red.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was enjoying the situation, and maintained a ruthless
silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel soon realized that he could look for no
assistance from the trader, who apparently considered that
the priest’s closer proximity to the enemy carried with it
the obligation to deliver the first attack. At last he stammered
out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Er—we have come—to tell the truth—to see you. H’m—about
a matter that—er—distresses us somewhat. And we
thought that—perhaps—it might be not altogether pleasant
to yourself—that is to say—of course—I mean, considering....”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Ørlygur slowly rose to a sitting position. Then setting
his hands firmly on his knees and leaning forward slightly,
he looked straight into the other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To tell the truth, Sera Daniel, I am not aware of any
matter which distresses me in any way at the moment. I
fancy your idea of something <em>mutually</em> unpleasant must be
due to a misunderstanding. Your troubles are hardly mine,
you know; the more so since we have seen very little of each
other for quite a long time now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, no, of course not. But—you know better than any
one else that it is you who set the example to all the parish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If that is so, you explain yourself badly. I stay away
from church, certainly—for the simple reason that I prefer to
avoid meeting a clergyman whom I dislike. My affair with
you will keep me away from church until it is settled—possibly
as long as you conduct the service there. If the rest
of your parishioners elect to do the same, it merely means that
your conscience will soon forbid you to remain as spiritual
guide to a flock who avoid you. If, on the other hand, your
conscience should prove more accommodating in this respect,
I have no doubt that the authorities will discover in a short
time what you are unable to see for yourself. You take my
meaning, Sera Daniel?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not sure that I do. I cannot see why a thoughtless
action on my part last spring—which I deeply regret—should
embitter you to such an extent that you stake the spiritual
welfare of the congregation in revenge.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, that’s rather too much. You say you regret your
thoughtlessness last spring. I translate that as meaning
simply that you regret having managed so badly; that you
realize the failure of your clumsy conspiracy against me, with
our friend the trader there—who seems worn out by the
heavy business of the summer season, since he apparently
can’t open his mouth. And then you haven’t even the
decency to keep this sordid affair to itself, but must mix it up
with the spiritual welfare of your congregation. Well, it
simply shows that you are more impudent even than I had
thought.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“If it were not that my position as incumbent here forces
me to set aside my personal interests—for the sake of the
parish, you understand—and to avert if possible the disastrous
consequences—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Disastrous? My dear Sera Daniel, you are a marvel.
Unless you take ‘the parish’ as meaning yourself and some
few others, I cannot see your argument at all. I do not regret,
and see no reason to regret, what has taken place, and I
am afraid ‘the parish’ takes the same view. I am not one
of those men who act hastily and afterwards regret their folly.
Candidly, Sera Daniel, your ideas are too vague and too complicated
for me to care to discuss them further. I have had
quite enough of empty talk; let us come to facts. And here
I imagine that Bjarni Jonsson will be better able to speak.
How very fortunate that he happened to come at the same
time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, turning to Bjarni, Ørlygur went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“As far as I remember, we arranged last time I saw you,
that you could come out here and buy my wool when you were
prepared to pay a decent price.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly—yes, of course. That is, I am ready&nbsp;... to
discuss....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, then. I hope the discussion will be brief. Let
me make it clear at the start that my terms are fixed, and not
intended as a basis for negotiation. You can, of course,
refuse them if you prefer, but I must insist on the matter being
settled quickly. I need not tell you, I suppose, that I bought
up all the wool I could last spring, when I realized that prices
would be exceptionally high—your books have no doubt made
that evident to yourself already. I am willing to let you
have all my wool at a reasonable price, as I know that many
of the peasants hereabout are in your debt, and that you are
anxious for a settlement. I myself am not in your debt. I
do not owe you money, and certainly very little consideration.
My peasants, on the other hand—you must excuse my calling
them ‘my peasants,’ we are linked, you know, by friendship
and common interests—my peasants owe you money, and I am
willing to offer my wool in clearance of their debts, or as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>much of their debts as it will cover. The debt will thus be
transferred to a creditor who can perhaps afford to give them
longer credit. You, I take it, are chiefly anxious to make
money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni sat with downcast eyes. The word of “the King”
cut him like a knife. He realized well enough that his business
at Hofsfjordur would be entirely ruined. Up till now
he had cherished a faint hope that Ørlygur would spare him,
if only he humbled himself sufficiently. At length he
realized, that though Ørlygur had mercifully saved him from
absolute ruin, and reduced his loss by paying the farmers’
debts, he would never have another customer unless he could
succeed in winning him over again. And the present reception
did not seem to offer any great hope of re-establishing that
connection.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet he still clung to the hope that by absolute humility he
might work on Ørlygur to extend his leniency still
further. Therefore, without a murmur, he agreed to
Ørlygur’s terms. He could not reconcile himself to the idea
of leaving the place and throwing up the excellent position
he had toiled and planned so many years to gain. He could
not bear to think that all was absolutely lost through his own
stupidity.</p>

<p class='c004'>His blood boiled at the thought, but he dared not show it;
his fate depended now on Ørlygur’s next move. And meanwhile,
his little cunning soul was on the alert for any
opportunity of showing “the King” what a loyal subject he
could be, and would, if only he might be forgiven this once.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, his heart was filled with a vindictive hatred—first
and foremost hatred of Ørlygur, then of Sera Daniel and
the rest of the community. Fate had been cruel to him, and
was mocking him into the bargain—the one consolation about
the whole affair was that things seemed as bad at least, if not
worse, for Sera Daniel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had Bjarni, the trader, but known that Ørlygur à Borg was
at that very moment filled with loathing for the servility he
displayed, he would have given vent to a burst of rage on the
spot—and it might have saved him, as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Ørlygur certainly felt sorry for the fellow; he knew how
much Bjarni had at stake, and how harmless and altogether
inferior he really was. He decided, therefore, to spare him,
if he could, by unreasonable demands, lead him to give up his
servile attitude and lose his temper in honest fashion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, my horses and men are at your disposal for
carrying the wool, if you wish to buy it—the price of transport,
of course, being in addition. I can let you have fifty
horses for the work, so it will not take long. The price—well,
it will simplify matters to fix one price for all wool of the
same colour. That is to say: one Krone for all white, and
half a Krone for the rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bjarni turned pale; for the moment he found it difficult to
control his features. He looked at Ørlygur with the eyes of
a wounded dog. But Ørlygur seemed not to notice his imploring
gaze, and went on carelessly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what do you say? Is that fair?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” stammered Bjarni in reply. Then, quickly, and
with an assumption of easiness, he added:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, that is settled. Tomorrow?” He nodded as
he said the last word; he felt that the moment had come to
change the tone of the conversation. This cheerful acceptance
on his part of an absurd price was a friendly hand, which
he expected Ørlygur would grasp at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>The effect, however, was contrary to what he had looked
for. Ørlygur seemed to take it as a personal affront; he rose
quickly, and said in an angry voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, then!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two visitors also rose, and without a word all three
walked from the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel also was highly dissatisfied with the result of
his visit. Both he and Bjarni were in a state of painful
suspense with regard to the future; they could not persuade
themselves that this was Ørlygur’s last word in the matter.
It was too dismal a failure for them to accept it as final.
Sera Daniel had hoped that the threatening cloud of Ørlygur’s
displeasure, which had darkened his work and prospects all
through the summer, would be dispelled. He fretted inwardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>over every word he had said, and the manner in which he had
spoken. Bjarni, too, had cherished similar hopes; an
amicable settlement meant even more to him than to the priest.</p>

<p class='c004'>As if by common instinct, both men hesitated to leave; their
manner showed plainly that there was more in their minds.
But Ørlygur pretended not to understand their anxiety, and
left it to them to make any further move.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meantime, they had reached the stables. And here they
stopped. Ørlygur seemed only waiting for them to take their
leave; but the visitors still hoped for some opening—something
to happen, they did not quite know what.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly the quivering notes of a violin were heard.
Here was a welcome excuse for delaying their departure.
Ørlygur was listening with delight, as so often before, to his
son’s playing; for a while all three stood motionless.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur smiled; a smile that covered, perhaps, both his
admiration and his aversion—the two conflicting feelings
which Ormarr’s playing always seemed to awaken at the same
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Sera Daniel spoke—simply and naturally:</p>

<p class='c004'>“How beautiful!” But at the same moment he reflected
that he ought to know Ørlygur’s character better than to say
things like that. And by way of altering the impression of
his words, he added, in an entirely different tone:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is the making of a fortune in that music.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg did not grasp his meaning. And though
he knew that Sera Daniel would never dare to make fun of
him, “the King,” to his face, he was on his guard. He looked
at the speaker with a glance of cold inquiry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“In foreign countries there are artists who make fortunes
by playing the violin. I have often wished that I were an
artist like that&nbsp;... it must be wonderful to travel from one
great city to another and be rich. I have heard such men in
Copenhagen, when I was studying there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Ørlygur à Borg realized that the priest’s words
pointed, not to impossible realms of fancy, but to a world of
beautiful reality, the look in his eyes changed. So strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>was his glance, so complete the alteration, that Sera Daniel
flushed with pleasure at the effect of his words.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while Ørlygur stared straight before him, as if in
thought. Great things were passing in his mind. Where
others would deliberate at length, Ørlygur à Borg was
capable of taking in a situation in a moment. He was thinking
of Ormarr’s and his brother’s future, and with his wonted
respect for sudden impulses, which he was almost inclined
to attribute to divine influence, he made up his mind quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to the priest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“While I think of it, Sera Daniel, there is a matter I have
been wanting to talk over with you for some time. Are you
going back home by the shorter road? Then I will go with
you part of the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The trader took the words as a hint to himself to disappear.
Bidding good-bye to Ørlygur and the priest, he rode off with
a troubled mind. This was worse than all; an understanding
between Ørlygur and Sera Daniel left him utterly hopeless.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel, on the other hand, was delighted at the honour
conferred on him by the King of Borg. Leading his horse,
he walked down the road with Ørlygur, waiting for what was
to come.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had made no mistake in calculating that the
fright he had given the priest would suffice to keep him from
any further attempts at revolt. After that lesson in the unwritten
law of the parish, Sera Daniel would be ready to
serve him to the utmost, if need should arise. And as things
were turning out now, the priest might well be useful to him,
in regard to the future of his sons. Ørlygur determined to
make peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked on for a while in silence. Then Ørlygur
spoke:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sera Daniel—would you undertake to teach Ormarr
Danish? He knows a little, and it would be as well for him
to improve on it before he goes away. He will be leaving for
Copenhagen this autumn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Daniel was almost moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A pleasure indeed—a very great pleasure. I am glad to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>hear he is going. There is a great future in store for him—of
that I feel sure. I have rarely heard any one play so well; he
seems far in advance of his age. You should send him to the
Conservatoire at Copenhagen—they will make a great artist
of him there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes—or to some eminent teacher.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At first—yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From first to last,” Ørlygur corrected, with a smile.
“He must have the very best teacher throughout. I am going
to give him every possible chance. And with regard to his
stay in Copenhagen, and matters generally, perhaps you could
give him some hints....”</p>

<p class='c004'>They discussed the matter at length. And when Sera
Daniel rode home, his fickle heart swelled with love and
admiration for Ørlygur the Rich, who had become his
gracious patron after the long, dreary months of enmity.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>That evening when Ormarr had driven the sheep into
the fold, he saw his father coming slowly towards him, and
realized that Ørlygur wished to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two sat down on the grassy wall of the paddock.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bjarni Jonsson has been up to buy the wool.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur spoke without any sign of triumph in his voice,
and Ormarr evinced no excitement at the information. To
both it seemed only natural and inevitable that the matter
should have ended thus.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sera Daniel came with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After this there was a pause. Then Ørlygur looked his son
in the eyes. “Ormarr,” he went on, “I have something important
to say to you. You are growing up now, and we must
think of your future. Not yours alone, but that of your
brother and the estate as well. In short, it concerns Borg.
Have you any wish to take over the management of the
place?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know....” Ormarr gazed thoughtfully before
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I will tell you what I have been thinking of today.
Sera Daniel tells me that there are men in foreign countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>whose whole work in life consists in playing the violin. You
understand, of course, that first of all they must learn to
master it thoroughly. They are taught at schools, or by
private teachers. Would you care to do the same—to learn
to play properly—rules and notes and everything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That means—going abroad?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr’s voice trembled, and he turned a little pale. The
golden bird of fortune and adventure flashed into the vision
of his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I spoke to Sera Daniel about teaching you English
as well as Danish. While you are in Copenhagen, you might
find time to study other languages, without neglecting your
music. Languages are always useful: if you become a great
artist, you may have to travel in many countries, play your
violin everywhere. Anyhow, you shall have the chance.
Perhaps your liking for it may not last, or you may find you
have not talent enough. If so, you can come back to Iceland
again—to Borg if you care to. What do you think—would
you like to try?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, father—if you will let me. It would be wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I pray God I may be allowed to live a few years more.
If you come back here, you will still have your birthright to
the estate. But if you prefer to give up your claim, I will
see that your brother is brought up to take over the place himself.
The next few years will show what is best.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr could not sleep that night. He lay weaving dreams
about his future.</p>

<p class='c004'>To him, it all appeared one bright, sunny vision. He
pictured life as one grand triumphal procession. He knew
that the country he was going to abounded in forests of
bright-hued beech and dark pine woods; with lovely
orchards, where ripe fruit hung on the trees ready for one
to pick and eat. He had read of Danish gardens, where
roses and lilac filled the air with their scent.</p>

<p class='c004'>He counted the days now till he should be able to look
with his own eyes on palaces he had known hitherto only
from pictures in books—real palaces of kings! They would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>be no longer castles in the air to him, but real; grand piles
of solid stone and mortar. He could walk through their
halls, breathe the air of bygone centuries that hung there
still; could touch with his hands the very walls that had
stood there for hundreds of years.</p>

<p class='c004'>He painted for himself a future like that of one of the
old Icelandic bards. He would play to kings and nobles.
There was a lust of travel in his blood, of wandering
through life by the royal road of glory and fame. It was
almost painful to remember that he had ever thought of
living all his days at Borg, as his ancestors had done.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great world called to him, and every fibre in him answered
to the call. He knew that there, where he was going,
were wonderful machines contrived to do the work of
men. He had never been able to think of such machines as
really inanimate things; he longed to see with his own eyes
the arms, hands, and fingers they must surely possess. Yet,
at the same time, the thought of it made his flesh creep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Think—to fill a room with light by the mere turning of a
switch! And to talk with people through a wire—which he
imagined as hollow. And there were places where conjurers
worked miracles, and acrobats performed impossible
feats; clowns jested and played tricks.... And gardens
filled with cages of strange beasts from countries even farther
off....</p>

<p class='c004'>All these and many other things which he had read of, and
grown to consider as accessible only to a favoured few, were
now to be part of his own surroundings in his daily life. He
would live in a city with streets like deep chasms between unscalable
cliffs—cave-hollowed cliffs peopled with human beings,
instead of giants and goblins. He would go to theatres,
where actors seemed to kill one another, and thunder, lightning,
and snow could be brought into play within four walls.
He would travel endless miles in machine-driven cars that
raced along over rails of steel....</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr lay in his dark room, his eyes wide open, letting
his fancy paint all manner of visions in the richest colours.
His mind was overwhelmed by a turmoil of new sensations.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>He tried to recall, one after another, all the pictures he
had seen of things in foreign lands; even to portraits of
celebrities, of jockeys galloping over turf, and sordid lithographs
with impossible figures in ridiculous postures, such as
he had seen stuck up in the local stores.</p>

<p class='c004'>A fever of anticipation burned in his veins. And when
at last, towards morning, he dropped off into a broken sleep,
he was still surrounded by a crowd of the impressions he had
conjured up while awake. They vexed him now; he found
himself being thrown from cars that raced away from him
at full speed, losing his way in gloomy streets and labyrinthine
passages, being snatched up by the steel arms of strange
machines and crushed to pieces; standing with one end of a
wire between his teeth and vainly trying to speak to a famous
man at the other end; he switched on a light and set the
house on fire, and was only saved from being burned to death
by waking to find the sun shining full in his face.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>When a youth is thrown from the realm of fancy
and solitude into a world of realities, one of two
things takes place: either a process of reaction
sets in, and he fortifies his soul in some faith or tradition; or
he clutches greedily at life, becomes intoxicated by it, and
loses his foothold. Whatever happens to him depends less
upon strength of character than upon chance.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Ormarr’s case, reality fell short of his expectation in
some respects, and in others exceeded it. He felt, also, as if
he were born anew, entering upon an existence based on new
principles.</p>

<p class='c004'>With all that he had looked forward to most keenly he was
frankly disappointed. On the other hand, he found an order
of things, of people and their actions, so alien to his own
mind and development that he felt himself an outsider, uncultured
and inferior. It seemed to him then, that the only
possible way to make up for lost time was to fling himself
headlong into this human maelstrom and swim for dear life.
And before he was himself aware of it, he was floating with
the tide. He soon proved to have all the requisite qualifications
for drifting so on the waters of life; he had means
enough, and withal a pleasant manner, with a certain air of
distinction, gay and yet self-possessed....</p>

<p class='c004'>It did not occur to him to consider whither he was drifting;
there was no time to think. That he saw no land ahead or
to either side did not trouble him in the least. Life was
pleasant enough—and since its essential aim seemed to be
that of making it pleasant, why trouble one’s head about
anything?</p>

<p class='c004'>Fortunately, there was always one plank at hand to which
he could turn for safety in case of need—unless he wilfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>thrust it from him. And as this resource in itself possessed
an extreme fascination for him—the chance of becoming a
great artist, a world-famed master—Ormarr never quite lost
touch of it, though he found it at times somewhat burdensome,
a check upon his natural movements towards pleasure and
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c004'>His consistency in this respect was largely due to the personality
of his teacher, Abel Grahl, who had taken a kind and
fatherly interest in the boy from their first meeting. On the
day after his arrival at Copenhagen, Ormarr set out from
his hotel at a very early hour, and went in search of Grahl.
Sera Daniel had instructed him to seek out this man and not
rest until he had persuaded him to become his teacher.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your career may depend upon it,” were the priest’s parting
words.</p>

<p class='c004'>Abel Grahl was an elderly man, and life had used him
hardly. At twenty, he had stood on the threshold of fame:
his first appearance as a violinist, in London, had created an
unusual stir. Offers of engagements came to him in plenty,
but the day before he was to start on a tour, embracing the
principal cities of the world, he had managed to hurt his
finger slightly while out boating with some friends. Blood-poisoning
set in, and the finger had to be amputated. Then
for three years he was lost to the world; his friends and relations
believed him dead. Suddenly he reappeared in his native
town of Copenhagen, a silent, retiring man; no one ever
learned where or how he had spent the intervening years.
Even his intimates refrained from asking, partly out of regard
for his grief, partly for fear of reopening some trouble
not yet healed. He made his living as a teacher of music
especially with the violin; but his pupils were few, since he
mercilessly rejected all save those who showed unusual
promise.</p>

<p class='c004'>He lived a solitary life, in a suite of rooms badly in need
of repair. The landlord had given him permission to remove
the inner partitions, and turn the whole place into one big
studio; the kitchen he used as a bedroom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grahl was not in the best of tempers on being awakened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>at six in the morning by a continued and vigorous ringing at
the bell. But at the sight of his visitor, a lad in ill-fitting
homespun clothes, with a calfskin bag tucked under his arm
(Grahl at once divined that it contained a violin), he found
some difficulty in keeping his countenance. He looked at the
boy with a faint, good-humoured smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr endeavoured to explain, in very imperfect Danish,
the object of his visit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man burst out laughing. Then, noticing the boy’s
confusion, he asked him in, and patted him encouragingly on
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean to say you have come all the way from Iceland
to learn the violin? What did you say your name
was?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr, son of Ørlygur à Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see, Ormarr à Borg, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, Ormarr Ørlygsson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr Ørlygsson. And how did you manage to find
me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was quite easy. I had the address written on a paper,
and asked the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, yes—but I mean, who told you to come to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sera Daniel—the priest. I was to come to you and get
you to teach me—you and no other. He said my career
might depend upon it. And he said if you refused, if you
sent me away once or twice or more, I was to try again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“H’m. Seems clear enough. And you look as if you were
the sort to do it. Well, let me hear what you can do with that
instrument of yours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr took out his violin. He was visibly nervous, and
it took him some time to tune up.</p>

<p class='c004'>Abel Grahl could not help remarking to himself that the
boy seemed awkward—and perhaps he did not even know
his notes. Anyhow, he refrained for the moment from
further questioning.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last Ormarr ran his bow across the strings, put down
his bow and violin, took off his coat, and rolled up his sleeves
to the elbow.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Grahl watched him, making no sign. He was rather
surprised to find himself really interested, and waited impatiently
for the boy to begin.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Ormarr took up his instrument again, the old man
asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“How old did you say you were?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr hesitated. “Fifteen,” he said at length.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grahl shook his head in despair. Then he checked himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well, we shall see. Go on now, if you are ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr began to play, without watching the other’s face.
He did not see how the man’s expression changed from mere
resignation to intense feeling, that drove all the blood from
his face. Now and again he frowned, and started slightly,
but repressed himself, and left Ormarr to finish at his will.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr played for ten minutes. At the last stroke of the
bow, Grahl leapt to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who wrote that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s—it’s only about a sunset.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, yes, but where did you get hold of it—the tune?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I made it up myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Grahl stared at him, but the boy never flinched. No,
those eyes could not lie!</p>

<p class='c004'>“What else can you play?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s all the songs they used to sing at home. And
the hymns from church.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can you play at sight?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean, do you know the written notes?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; I was never taught.” Ormarr felt crushed at the
confession.</p>

<p class='c004'>For fully a quarter of an hour he was kept in suspense;
it was like waiting for the summons to execution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Abel Grahl walked up and down. Now and again he
stopped full in front of the boy, scrutinizing him from head
to foot. Then he shook his head as if in dismissal, turned
away abruptly, and stood for a while at the window, whistling
softly to himself; came back and stared at Ormarr once
more, looking hard into the dark, glowing eyes that seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to have grown dim. Who could say how much it might
mean to this lad if he sent him away? He felt, too, that
those eyes could express something more than despair.</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt himself drawn toward this child of nature who
had been flung at him, at it were, like a ball, from hundreds
of miles away—if he did not take it but threw it back,
would it land safely, or would it be lost in the sea?</p>

<p class='c004'>At last he spoke, though he had not yet made up his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a difficult thing to study—and it means years of
work. Also, it will cost a great deal of money. Where are
you to get that from?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From my father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what is your father?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A farmer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he rich?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is he worth, about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He owns all Borg, and....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean, how many thousand...?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three thousand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three thousand—is that all?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. No one in Iceland has more than three thousand
sheep. He has more than any one else there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sheep—I see. A biggish place, then. Many horses?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know how many exactly. There are many—<em>stodhross</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>Stodhross</em>—what’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Horses that live out on the hills. But we’ve a hundred
and twenty at home, on the place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The devil you have. And how many cows?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“About a hundred most times.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know any one here in Copenhagen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. But the priest, he gave me a letter to a man I was
to ask to keep my money for me, if you did not care to be
troubled with it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you much with you now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have a thousand Kroner in my pocket-book, and a few
small notes in my purse.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“H’m. I suppose you can look after your money all right
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh yes, I have it....” He thrust a hand into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No—I must have left it under my pillow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Under your pillow—where?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the place where I slept.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What on earth—Here, we must go along at once. Put
on your coat—no, never mind the violin. Where are you
staying? What street?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know what street it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But good heavens, child—the name of the hotel, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hotel H——, it is called. Sera Daniel told me to go there
the first night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They reached the street, and Grahl hurried on ahead to
where some cabs were standing. Hailing one, he gave the
address, hurried the boy in, and followed himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the vestibule of the hotel they were met by the porter,
who advanced with a discreet smile, and handed a pocket-book
to Ormarr.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t seem to care much for your money, sir. The
maid found this little sum under your pillow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The little episode was not perhaps, in itself, the decisive
factor in establishing the ultimate relationship between
Ormarr and Grahl. But it certainly did much to link them
closer, and from that time forth, Grahl assisted the young
Icelander in many other ways, apart from merely teaching
him the violin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr succeeded from the first in winning the old man’s
affection, and making him interested in his career. He was
a constant source of surprise to his teacher. First and foremost,
there was his sudden transformation from chrysalis to
butterfly—from a peasant lad to a man-about-town.</p>

<p class='c004'>And Ormarr caused his teacher grave anxiety during
those years. But he never betrayed the confidence the old
man had shown at first. And in point of musical development
he surpassed all that Grahl had ever hoped for.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the tenth winter, Grahl considered his pupil as perfect
at least as he himself had been when he had first appeared in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>public. All that was needed now was to introduce him to
an audience. The day for his début was fixed, and the large
room at the Concert Hall engaged.</p>

<p class='c004'>For some time past, whispers had been current in musical
circles about Abel Grahl’s wonderful pupil. All were eager
to hear him, and every seat in the big hall was taken far in
advance.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had rooms on the outskirts of the town, looking
out over the Sound. In course of time, he had managed to
get the apartments furnished to his taste. The walls were
hung with rugs, an enormous divan occupied the centre of
the room, a few small tables stood about here and there, and
the four big chairs were packed with cushions. The divan
served as a bed at night; in the daytime it was covered with
a splendid Persian rug. Black, white, and brown sheepskins
were spread on the floor, and in front of the divan was flung
the pelt of a huge white bear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not a single picture was to be seen. But on the walls,
hidden behind the hangings, Ormarr had placed large reproductions
of well-known portraits of great composers.
And when playing, he would uncover the picture of that
particular master with whose work he was occupied for the
moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the day before his first concert, Ormarr was resting,
fully dressed, on the divan. He was smoking; a bottle of
wine and a glass stood within reach on a small table.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had been out for his usual morning walk. But for the
last three hours he had not moved. It was now drawing towards
twilight. His glance moved idly from one window to
the other, following the race of clouds against the background
of a dull blue sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a knock at the door. Languidly Ormarr rose
to open. He recognized the voice of his friend, Aage
Blad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Save for Grahl, Ormarr’s only intimate friend was the
young poet, Aage Blad; the two were constant companions.
Blad’s earnest love of life had endeared him to Ormarr, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>though the latter, true to his adopted rôle of insincerity,
often made fun of his friend’s seriousness, the poet had soon
realized that it was not meant, and as a rule paid no heed to
it. But if ever he found that he had gone too far, Ormarr
always relapsed into silence, and his friend understood that
this was his way of asking forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Blad glanced at Ormarr’s face as he entered, and gathered
at once that his friend was not in the best of spirits. He
shook hands in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr flung himself down on the divan once more, leaving
his visitor to make himself at home. Blad moved up a
chair, and the two friends smoked in silence for a while,
watching each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nervous?” queried Blad at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wish I were!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Curious thing to wish. Thank your stars you’re as cool
about it as you are. Anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, that’s no trifle, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you what, Ormarr, I shan’t feel comfortable myself
until this concert’s over. Honestly, I’m getting quite feverish
about it. I’ve never been so excited about one of my
own things coming out—not even my first book.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need for you to get excited that I can see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need at all—you’re right, of course. It’s bound to
go off all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the contrary—there’s everything to be anxious about.
Everything—everything. Oh, well, hang it all—have another
drink.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr threw himself back and closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aage Blad sat watching him; there was a dull, resigned
expression about the corners of the mouth; the forehead was
already deeply lined. There was strength as well as weakness
in the face, he thought. “A strange fellow,” he told
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>They smoked in silence for a while. Then, without opening
his eyes, Ormarr said:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“It is a long time since I saw my home. Funny thing,
not feeling home-sick all these years. Can’t understand it
just now. I never longed for home till this winter. As
soon as the summer comes I must go back. Like to come
too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“H’m—I don’t know. Iceland—the very name of it
makes me shiver. Anyhow, you’ll have to redeem that fur
coat you gave me—extravagant person that you are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it’s not so cold at home. Not in the summer, at
any rate. The coldest thing about Iceland is its name. And
the nights there—so wonderfully calm and light they are in
spring.... It’s a long time to wait till the spring. I wish
I were back home again now. I’ve never seen a sky so blue
and deep as there. Before I came to Denmark I had an
idea that in a flat country one would see more of the sky
than at home, with all the mountains and their shadows.
But then the mountains are so far away. And once you get
there&nbsp;... Aage, I would give all the forests in the world,
all the orchards and cornfields and flower gardens, for a
single mountain. But a real one, mind you, with huge rocky
ridges, and green plateaus, and snow at the top. Good
heavens, man, to think that I have one all to myself—yes,
I own a mountain. I never thought of it before. Can you
understand how I ever could stay away from it all so long?
But I’m going back now—going home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s the concert first, don’t forget—tomorrow. And
you’re going to be famous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tomorrow&nbsp;... yes....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had sat up, resting on his elbow, while he spoke
of his home. Now, he threw himself back once more, as if
exhausted, and lay with closed eyes as before. For a few
moments neither spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aage,” said Ormarr at last, “I feel tired—deadly tired.
I’ve been idling here all day. Tomorrow? I feel as if tomorrow
were already a thing of the past.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He got up, filled his glass and that of his friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drink! Aage, I’ve something to tell you. Just let me
go on talking, and don’t bother about it, I only want to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>it out. What do you think I’ve been seeing all the time,
lying here with my eyes shut? This is no life for me. I
have been counting. It is my tenth winter here now. Ten
years, man—think! And today it seemed as if I had come
yesterday. I have been asleep—fast asleep. But it can’t
go on. There’s something hurting me, a sort of longing——Oh,
I know it sounds all nonsense, but you needn’t worry
about that.... No, this won’t do. I don’t go on drinking
and enjoying life in this wasteful, silly fashion—and forgetting.
I wasn’t made to live like that. I was made to think,
and to work. And now here have I been living for ten years—yes,
and working hard, I know—but all for nothing. It
means nothing at all, really. Famous? If I found myself
famous after tomorrow, I should be no better off than I am
now. I’ve no ambition of that sort any longer—not a scrap.
I never realized it before—it’s only just lately I’ve seen it.
And think of dear old Abel Grahl! Do you know, honestly,
I believe he’s jealous—the dear old boy! He’s fond of me,
I know; and now that I’m on the eve of my ‘conquest,’ as
he always says, he thinks of the time when he made his conquest—and
fate overtook him after. I’m sadly afraid that
old trouble’s cropped up again now with him. And after
all, what is there to envy, anyway? What sort of a future
if I do succeed? The life of a flunkey—a menial in gold
lace, playing for money—and to whom? I’ve been studying
my fellow-creatures this winter—musical people—my
audience-to-be. Copenhagen’s not the world I know; but
human beings are much the same everywhere, I take it,
though their looks and manners may differ somewhat in detail.
Grahl has been taking me about. He hates ‘society,’
I know, but he took it all up again for my sake—that’s the
sort of man he is. It all helps, he says. Oh, and you should
have heard their talk, their hard-and-fast opinions, and the
views of the professional critics. Sometimes I feel I simply
can’t go on living. Simply can’t stand it. What wretched
caricatures we all are—myself included. No I’ve finished
with this sort of life. There’s not a thing in the world I
care for now, except to go back home. If only I could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>sure <em>that</em> was a genuine feeling, and not another delusion.
Don’t look down on me, old man—Heaven knows, I’ve no
great thoughts about myself just now. You know me well
enough to see that I’m not drunk. But I feel—oh, just
worthless. All these years—and living like this—it’s too
contemptible. I feel as if I hadn’t an atom of will-power
left. Just sick and tired of everything&nbsp;... and longing,
aching for something.... Good of you to listen so patiently.
Have a drink.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Blad was silent for some time, and when at last he spoke
it was in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s something I should like to say to you,” he said
quietly. “And I’m half afraid to begin. I’ve been thinking
a lot, and some of it I mustn’t say at all. But I will say
this: When we have been together anywhere—out in the
country, or on the sea, or in the town—anywhere, I always
had a feeling that we lived as it were on different levels, you
and I. To me, you were always the born leader; I felt if you
took it into your head to order me about, I should have to
obey. Things seemed somehow to belong to you. Then at
other times, I could feel as if you were a distinguished visitor—one
can’t help these stray thoughts, you know—as if Nature
herself put on her best and did all she could to please
you—while I was just an ordinary person, not worth making
a fuss about. I belonged to her, as one of her children, and
could stray about unnoticed among the trees like any other
creature in the forest; it never came into my head to look on
her in that gay lordly way of yours. And sometimes it
seemed you were the better off; sometimes that it was better
to be as I was. It’s all only fancies, of course, but still it
does prove one thing: that we are utterly different. I am
quite content to live an ordinary uneventful life; as long as
I can ramble about in Nature’s garden and cultivate the
modest growths of my art, it is enough for me. I don’t care
for anything that calls for greater energy than I generally
give, whether it be the way of pleasure, or pain, or work.
I’ve no ambition worth mentioning. I can sit in my garden,
and enjoy the scent of the flowers, or go out in a boat, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>watch the sunlight on the water; walk in the woods in spring
and see the delicate green of the beech leaves against the sky—I
am happy enough with such things. There are heaps of
little trifling things of that sort that please me every day.
But it’s all different with you. It may sound theatrical,
perhaps, but it’s as if you had mountains—glaciers and volcanoes—in
your soul. And I shouldn’t care to change with
you—it’s all too big for me. But then again, if you were like
me, I shouldn’t care about you. You must live and act in a
different way; I see that. You could stand suffering better
than I; I’m sure of that. But I’m not quite sure that you
have the power of being really happy. Anyhow—well, you
know I’m your friend, and always will be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know that, Blad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr got up, switched on the light, looked through a
bundle of newspapers and found the one he was looking for.
Nervously he turned the pages till he came to the shipping
intelligence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a boat leaving the day after tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He dropped the paper, walked up and down the room
several times, shaking his head defiantly, as if at his own
thoughts, then threw himself down in a chair. A moment
later he glanced at his watch, and rose reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s time I went round now—to Grahl. The final
rehearsal....”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>In the big room where, ten years before, a curious figure
of a boy in ill-fitting clothes had called on him for the first
time, Abel Grahl sat at the piano accompanying the later
stage of that same youth—now a slender, pale-faced young
man. They were playing a nocturne—the only one of
Ormarr’s own compositions on the morrow’s program.
The theme was that same one of the sunset with which
Ormarr had introduced himself to his master, only the
technique was different.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr looked out through the window as he played, seeing
nothing in particular. As long as he held his violin, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>soul lived only in the magic world of melody that flowed
from the strings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grahl’s accompaniment was strangely absent and
mechanical. His figure was bowed at the shoulders, and the
black coat he wore accentuated his thinness. He had aged
much of late, and looked haggard and worn. Now and again
he turned his head towards his pupil with a searching glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they had been through the whole of the programme,
Grahl remained seated at the instrument, striking one chord
repeatedly, his eyes fixed on nothing. The corners of his
mouth dropped in a bitter smile. Then, turning to Ormarr,
he said in a queer, strained voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Play that Andante once more, will you? Not that you
need it—it couldn’t be better. Just play it for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Ormarr played.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he had finished, Grahl spoke, without looking up, as
to himself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was one of the things I played at my first concert.
I did not play it as well as you—no, not half so well. I doubt
if Beethoven himself ever played it better!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while he sat with bowed head. Then raising himself
suddenly, he ran his fingers over the keyboard, and the
gay tones of the “Valse d’Espagne” danced like demons out
upon the silence that had followed Beethoven’s Andante.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr, who had been standing deep in thought, looked
round with a start; Grahl rose from the music-stool with a
harsh laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A fancy of mine,” he said shortly, “to let Waldteufel
loose on the heels of Beethoven.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went across to the table, lit a cigar, and slipped into
an easy-chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr followed his movements intently. There was a
strange expression in his eyes, and the lines on his forehead
and face seemed deeper than usual.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grahl paid no heed to him; he was smoking, and evidently
occupied with his own reflections. When Ormarr moved, he
looked up, and pointed to a chair.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Sit down, Ormarr; not time to go home yet. Take a
cigar.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr took a cigar and lit it, covertly watching the expression
of the old man’s face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sit there, Ormarr, where I can see you; that’s it. I was
thinking, there’s not much left of the peasant lad who came
up here that morning ten years ago. The eyes are the same,
yes; and a look about the face—I’ve noticed it the last few
days.... Anyhow, it was as well I didn’t send you away
that day after all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr felt his cheeks flush, and bent forward in his
chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My dear Grahl, I feel myself a man now in most things,
but there’s one thing that has stuck to me since I was a child.
I never could thank any one in words. And I don’t know
how to thank you in any other way.... I’m sure no father
ever did more for his son than you have done for me. I
hardly know how any one could do more for a fellow-creature
than you have.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh.... And what is this, if you please, if not thanking
me in words?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know yourself how much I owe you—you know I
don’t exaggerate things as a rule....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There, Ormarr, that’s enough. You must have seen what
it meant to me all along—the joy and delight of teaching
you. No more pupils now for Abel Grahl. You are my last—and
my greatest. If I could find one greater still...?
I don’t think I shall live to be roused from my bed a second
time at six in the morning by a lad with his fiddle in a calfskin
bag and the promise of fame in his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr laughed at the thought. A moment later he was
serious once more. And Grahl went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll go travelling about the world, giving concerts here,
there, and everywhere. I wish I were strong enough to go
with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr laughed again, but without heartiness.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Grahl, my dear master, why not? Come with me!
Nowadays, with trains de luxe and floating palaces, it will be
pleasant as could be. And at least I should have some one to
play for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I&nbsp;... to travel&nbsp;... after all? It’s late in the day&nbsp;... and not exactly the way I had once thought....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr sprang to his feet, but sat down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Grahl, you are my friend—the best I have, I think. I
must tell you something now—something that has happened
to me. Listen: I do not care about the concert tomorrow—it
means nothing. Fame is nothing to me now. To tell the
truth, I shudder at the thought of going about playing for
people I do not know, and should not care to know. Strangers—foreigners!
It makes me a piece of common property;
one of the artistic wonders of the world. And then to see my
name, my portrait, on huge posters everywhere&nbsp;... read
interviews with myself, criticisms of my art—Grahl, the
thought of it sickens me. I won’t—I can’t—oh, if only I
could get out of it now, before....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, boy&nbsp;... Ormarr, my dear lad, what is this?
what has come over you? Surely you do not—you could
not think of throwing everything away now—burning
your ships? Ten years of hard work—yours and mine....
If there were any risk, I could understand perhaps your being
afraid&nbsp;... but as it is&nbsp;... you have only to show yourself—one
first appearance, and the thing is done. No,
Ormarr, you could not draw back now. It would be madness—nothing
else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That may be. But none the less, that is how I feel. I
have lost all desire to show myself, to appear in public. I
do not care for any ‘conquest.’ I could do it, I know. But
that means that in reality I have already conquered. It is
satisfaction enough to me; I need not show myself on a platform
to utter strangers who have paid so much for the right
to hear me play this or that. Every item on the programme
as a right—and extras in return for their applause. No—if
you cared, I should not mind playing to you every day, for
hours together—to you alone. Or to any others that I cared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>about. Come back with me to Iceland. I will look after you,
be a son to you, take care of you, in every way. But spare me
this; release me from the burden of that concert and all that
should come after it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr—you must be out of your senses.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whether or no, I am what I am. And I can’t be otherwise.
I am furious with myself too; blind fool that I
have been—oh, you don’t know what I feel at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr noticed that Grahl was feeling for his watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t,” he put in hastily. “I don’t want to see any
one tonight. I can’t stand it. I don’t know what may
happen....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Abel Grahl rose from his seat. When he spoke, his voice
was calm and earnest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr, remember I stand to you in a father’s stead.
You cannot get away from this. Where is my son, who had
grown to be a man of the world? We had grown out of
stage fright, nerves and all that nonsense, surely? Tomorrow
is our concert. We must not forget it, we must be
there in time. But beyond that, we need not give the matter
a thought. There—that’s the way to look at it. Don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr paled slightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well—have it your own way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A car was heard hooting outside, and they went out.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr stood on the platform of the Concert Hall, playing
the Andante from Beethoven’s Sonata. This was the third
item on the programme. The first had been a show piece,
from Tchaikowsky, which had given him an opportunity of
displaying his extraordinary skill and masterly technique.
After the second, his own nocturne, it seemed as if the
applause would never end. The audience was delirious.
The atmosphere of the nocturne, with its melancholy depths
and wild heights of joy, its bewildering beauty and strange
transitions, moved the dense crowd as if by magic.</p>

<p class='c004'>The appearance of the young artist had fascinated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>listeners from the outset. Despite the air of superiority and
composure, there was nothing of arrogance in his bearing.
At the first entry of this young man, with the pale, lean face
and the half-closed eyes that yet seemed to see everything, and
see through every one, the audience felt the magnetism of an
extraordinary personality.</p>

<p class='c004'>Success was certain, inevitable. From the very first, the
audience had surrendered unconditionally.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he stood there playing, Ormarr appeared quite calm
and collected. Not the slightest tremor of the body, no trace
of expression on his smooth face, betrayed the struggle raging
within. But Ormarr himself knew that it was merely a question
of time; up to a certain point he might control himself—after
that, the deluge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two men there were, however, among those in the hall, who
suspected something of the strain it cost him to keep his rebellious
temperament in check: they knew that his apparent
calm was but a mask. The two were Blad and Abel Grahl,
sitting together in the front row.</p>

<p class='c004'>The serene progress of the Andante was undisturbed by
any sound from those in front. Ormarr felt as if his listeners
were turned to stone, and his playing was caressing them
like a gentle breeze.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly there came over him an irresistible desire
to jerk them back to life—to startle them, set them fluttering
and cackling like a pack of frightened fowls. To tear at
their sense, to render their innermost souls, to fling at them,
like a fiery volcanic eruption, something unexpected and
terrible—something unheard of.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a fraction of a second it had come. A bursting of all
bonds that chained his ungovernable mind: reason, duty,
ambition, the fear of consequences. It was as if in a moment
he flung from him the prejudices and traditions in which
men are wont to dress, and stood there before them in primeval
nakedness.</p>

<p class='c004'>He saw Grahl trying to rise: trying to prevent something
he knew was coming....</p>

<p class='c004'>And half unconsciously, as if it had been the most natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>thing in the world, he plunged blasphemously from Beethoven’s
Andante into Waldteufel’s “Valse d’Espagne.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was cool and calm as ever, but pale as a ghost.
The music raced away madly into the waltz, laughing and
crying in complete abandon.</p>

<p class='c004'>A feeling of something uncanny seized the audience for
a second; as if icy waters had overwhelmed them in flood,
depriving them of movement, suffocating all cries for help.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grahl rose to his feet, and opened his mouth as if to cry
aloud. Then he fell back in his chair, without a sound.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Ormarr stopped playing; his arms fell to his
sides, and he stood on the platform laughing—a tremulous,
uneasy laugh. Then he turned and fled.</p>

<p class='c004'>A storm of shouts and noise rose up from the audience.
The silence of enraptured listeners had given place to the
confusion of a disturbed ant-hill. Some questioned, others
raged, a few broke down entirely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Scandalous!” “Mad!” sounded through the din.
Several minutes passed before any thought of leaving.
Then suddenly the word “dead” began to circulate. And
gradually the crowd grew quiet, and dispersed, moved to
forgiveness by the thought that the madman had ceased to
live. Only a few were aware that it was not the player who
was dead.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr reached home and let himself in—not until then
did he notice that he had walked all the way without hat or
overcoat, still carrying his violin.</p>

<p class='c004'>After all, what did it matter? His mind was in a state
of utter indifference to everything; completely numbed.</p>

<p class='c004'>His shoes were muddy, his dress coat wet through; he
raised his hand to his forehead and wiped the rain from his
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>His throat was parched; he felt nervous and ill. He fumbled
about for whisky and a syphon, drained one glass at a
draught and poured out another. Then, drenched and dirty
as he was, he threw himself down on the divan, without a
thought of changing his wet things.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The blood throbbed in his temples; there was not a clear
thought in his mind. When he shut his eyes, he felt as if a
wheel were tearing round at a furious rate inside his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door bell rang—it was Blad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Grahl is dead!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Blad threw down Ormarr’s hat and coat, which he had
been carrying; he himself was out of breath, and overpowered
with emotion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Grahl—dead?” Ormarr sat bowed forward, his hands
clasped, his eyes staring vacantly before him. Blad stood
watching him for a moment. Then he burst out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You—you must be mad!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose so—yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And—you don’t care in the least?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr made no reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Think of the scandal of it all!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Still Ormarr said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then—Grahl! That ought never to have happened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean to say it is all nothing to you—that you
have ruined your own career for ever, and killed Grahl—your
friend—your teacher? After that—oh, but you must
be insane, there’s no other word for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were you drunk?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drunk? No, I wasn’t drunk. But do let’s talk of something
else. It’s no good discussing this any more. It’s done,
and can’t be undone. I am going back home—to Iceland.
There’s a boat leaving tomorrow. Take off your coat, won’t
you—you’re going to stay now? Mix yourself a drink, man,
do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, thank you.” Blad spoke coldly, flinging out his
words, and pacing the floor excitedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I hurt you too? I can’t think how I could have
done that. Surely you can’t feel hurt at my being what I
am, and doing what I can’t help doing? I asked you to stay
just now, because I thought you were my friend. If you are
no longer my friend, then you had better go.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Really, I almost fancy you would like to turn me out now
because I decline to drink with you to Grahl’s happy decease.
By Heaven, you do not deserve that I should stay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you damned fool—who’s talking about what I
deserve!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Blad stopped suddenly, as if paralysed by the word.
Then in a voice heavy with emotion, he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr—that was the first ugly word I have ever heard
you use. And it was said to me—to me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To you—yes. But you made me angry, you know. Up
to then, I was only miserable—and so hopelessly tired. And
here you are reproaching me for things I could not help.
And really, you know, when you are so utterly foolish as to
measure me by your standards, I can’t call you anything
else. I don’t repent what I did tonight. How can a man
repent things that <em>happen</em>—things over which he had no control
whatever? But I do repent—or at least, I am sorry—for
what happened before—for what brought it all about.
Grahl was my friend and benefactor—and yet I cannot feel
any grief at his death. I simply can’t think at all at the
present moment; haven’t a single atom of emotion in me.
I’m just a wilderness. Oh, if you knew what I am suffering
now—death would be welcome; a relief. There’s just one
thing that grows and grows in me now—the need to go back,
to go home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And your father—what will he say, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father? I don’t know. I wonder what he will say.
It will be a big disappointment to him, this. How could I
ever have done it? I don’t understand myself now—it all
seems so ridiculous; to lose control of oneself like that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Blad started.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then—then you didn’t do it on purpose?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good heavens, no! Did you—could you think that of
me? I suppose you fancied it was a new sort of advertising
trick—well, why not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr—forgive me. But you were so cool about it all—I
never thought....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, never mind. We won’t worry about it any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>more. I’m dead tired. Stay here tonight, won’t you? I’m
not going to bed; no good trying to sleep. Stay and see me
off; the boat goes at nine. Thanks, that’s good of you. Get
some sleep, if you can, yourself. There’s a lot of things I’ll
want you to do for me while I’m away. Send me—no&nbsp;...
no, I won’t have any of these things here. You can take
them over—keep what you care about and sell the rest. I
want to forget these years—as far as I can. Though I’ve
learned much in the time—and paid dearly for it. Now I
am going home—going home to Iceland, and then&nbsp;... what
next, I wonder?”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>It was a bright wintry day when Ormarr, watching from
the captain’s bridge, saw his native land rise snow-clad
from the blue-green sea against a high, clear sky.
The captain noticed that the fur-clad man who had been
up on the bridge since early that morning to get the first
glimpse of land, seemed strangely moved at the sight of it.
Well, it was none of his business....</p>

<p class='c004'>Never before had Ormarr seen Iceland rising thus out of
the sea; he had but a dim notion of the grandeur of the sight.
Unconsciously, he had always thought of Iceland in the green
of spring or summer, and had looked forward to seeing it so
on his return. Being winter, of course, there would be snow.
But he had never thought to see it all so white and clean
and brilliant as now.</p>

<p class='c004'>A vague joy filled him as he looked; he felt that his soul
was come of the race of those great mountains, as of a line of
kings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Iceland—his country! Like a cathedral, a consecrated
pile of granite, pure and holy in the seas of the far north.
And the snow—how he loved it! And the rocks, the hills
and valleys&nbsp;... the brooks and streams, sleeping their
winter sleep now, under the ice. And fire too, the marvellous,
merciless fire, smouldering quietly in its lava bed, yet
strong enough to melt the ice of a hundred years in less than
a minute and hurl it in huge floods of boiling water and redhot
rocks and lava down the mountain-side, through the
valleys, out into the sea. What did it care for men, or their
goods or their lives! All had to die. And better to die by
fire or ice than on a bed of sickness. Far better to die young
in some mighty upheaval than to drag palsied bones through
a dreary wilderness of old age.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Ormarr smoothed his brow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Why think of dying now? He was still young, and fit for
action. Yet if Mother Iceland should think fit to crush him
to his death in her embrace, well, he was ready. Well for
him, perhaps, to find death on her icebound, fiery heart, if the
road of life proved too wearisome.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strange thoughts—was he mad, after all? He was thinking
now as he had done so often when a child. But his
dreams had changed. Then, Iceland had been the starting-point
of his imaginings; it had been as a weight at his heel,
keeping him in bondage, holding him back from all that he
thought made life worth living. Now it was changed—now
all his dreams turned towards it, centred round it—Iceland
now was his home. Home? No, he had no home anywhere
on earth. Yet he felt drawn towards it none the less; longing
for his country....</p>

<p class='c004'>But what was this—Iceland—hovering above him, looking
down at him—would she no longer receive him? Was he her
child no more? Had the world worn away the marks by
which his mother had known him?</p>

<p class='c004'>Foolishness—his brain was running wild. And yet—how
was it with him, after all? Was it not true that he was
unworthy of love—a failure, self-condemned?</p>

<p class='c004'>Iceland, towering in shining armour, in glittering floes and
spotless mantle of snow. And one coming to her from the
outer world, with the dirt of alien countries on his feet, and
the pain and weariness of the world in his heart. Her sacred
places were no longer open to him now; closed, locked; the
keys hidden far away, not there. Perhaps in the place
whence he had come, perhaps far distant, on some
other continent. Or hidden, maybe, on the other side of
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Iceland! As he watched the land rise from the cold blue
waves, he felt that he, who once had been her child, was no
longer worthy to be so. He had sinned in coming back at
all. And he vowed in his heart to set out once more in quest
of the key that might unlock its holy places to him once more.
Whatever happened, he must go away again. And if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>could not find what he sought, then there could be no return.
Only let him first breathe the air here for a little while, tread
the soil that had been his father’s—men who had never
shamed their native land.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again he smoothed his forehead—the movement had become
a habit with him whenever he wished to check or change
a train of thought. And he laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Ormarr Ørlygsson, my friend and brother,” he
thought to himself, “this time you are certainly mad&nbsp;...
mad beyond cure&nbsp;... caught in the act—hysteria pure and
simple.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sighed deeply—there was an ache at his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” he thought. “If I go on like this&nbsp;... if
I let my thoughts and fancies play at will like this, I shall end
as a lunatic: lose all control over myself, and be shut up
somewhere—a pleasant prospect! Or at best, be allowed to
go about at home in a living death: a beast with instincts and
no soul, on the place I was born to rule. And father—to
see his son an object of pity or contempt.... No: I must
get away now, before something happens. Better perhaps
not to land at all, but go on round the coast, and back with the
steamer to Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we shall see. Most likely it would be the wisest
thing to do. On the other hand, it would be cruel to
father....</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait and see. Let me at least feel the soil of my own
country under my feet: touch the snow, drink its water, and
breathe its air—satisfy myself that it is not a vision merely,
no fairy tale, but a reality.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At the first port Ormarr went ashore. He felt happy as
a child, and laughed and joked with the crew. And when
the boat neared the pier, he waved his hand to the crowd
there, though he did not know a soul among them. They
shrank back a little at the gay familiarity on the part of a
stranger—but Ormarr did not care.</p>

<p class='c004'>He set out on foot to explore the neighbourhood, a poor
enough place it was. It was only with an effort that he
restrained himself from walking up to the windows of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>little houses and looking in, or knocking at the doors, just
to breathe the atmosphere of a home in his own country.</p>

<p class='c004'>On an open space some boys were racing about playing
snowballs. This was too much for Ormarr; before he knew
it, he was in the thick of the fight, and in a moment he had
all the lads on top of him. With shouts and laughter they
pelted him from all sides, and ended by fairly burying him
in the loose snow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys stood around laughing heartily when at last,
gasping for breath, he emerged; this was a first-rate playmate
that had suddenly appeared from nowhere. Eager
queries were hurled at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>A tall, freckled peasant lad came up and asked his name,
others equally inquisitive put their questions without giving
him time to reply to the first. Was he from the steamer just
come in? Where had he come from? From Copenhagen?
What had he been doing there? Was he going on with the
steamer again? If so, he would have to hurry; the second
whistle had already gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the whole crowd followed him down to the harbour,
two of the smaller boys taking each a hand. When he gave
them some small coin, they decided that he must be the new
Governor at the very least, and felt some tremors at the disrespectful
manner in which they had treated such a personage.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the boat rowed off to the steamer, they stood on the pier
waving their caps, and stayed there, waving and shouting as
the vessel moved off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr felt unspeakably grateful for this welcome from
his country—a welcome of smiles, and snow, and youth; the
glowing warmth that was in its element amid the biting cold.
He felt himself akin to these lads, with their hands and faces
warm and wet from perspiration and melting snow; who
rolled about in the snowdrifts despite their clothing, braved
the cold and the roughness of the elements, enjoying themselves
in the depth of an arctic winter as well as in any tropical
summer heat. They had no idea of modern precautions
against climate.</p>

<p class='c004'>There they stood, waving to him, acknowledging him as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>one of their own, never dreaming that he had been about to
drift away into an artificial life that nursed the frailties of the
body regardless of health, until the body became a thing to
loathe, unless the soul itself were cynically hardened.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the moment for action, the time to pull oneself
together and decide; here was the way to follow—follow it!</p>

<p class='c004'>But first of all, to find the right way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr felt now that he could go back to his father. Could
tell him all, confess that he had chosen a wrong path, a way
whereby his body might have passed unscathed, but his soul
never—it was never meant that the two should be divided.
He must rest and think for a while and find a new
road.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more Ormarr had climbed to the bridge, and remained
there till the steamer touched at the next port. It would be
a couple of days before he could reach home.</p>

<p class='c004'>The day wore away, and night came down, but it was still
quite light. The moon was high, right over the land, its white
glow hovering over the landscape and giving it an air of
unreality, like a spell that held all things in the bonds of
sleep. The ship itself, chained to a silver beam, was the
captive of this enchanted country, for all that it kept on
its course; sooner or later, it seemed, the time would come
when it must crash on a rocky coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr turned from the moon, forgetting the base designs
which he had just attributed to its dull red bridge of rays.
He looked at the stars—and suddenly he remembered the
summer nights at home, when he had lain out among the hay
in the fields, unable to draw his eyes from the twinkling
golden points of light.</p>

<p class='c004'>The northern lights flickered and faded, and showed up
anew; like fiery clouds, appearing suddenly on one horizon,
to vanish in a flaming trail behind another. Ormarr loved
them—their restlessness, their capricious, fantastic shapes,
the play of mood through every imaginable shade of colour—it
was a silent musical display of heavenly fire.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Next day, the captain and Ormarr were alone on the bridge.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Each was occupied with his own thoughts, and both were
gazing towards the shore.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See there, Hr. Ørlygsson—that ring of mist there round
the peak. Now, mist, I should say, is white as a rule, but
looking at it there, against the snow, it looks just grey.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr made some brief reply; he was studying the face
of the little Danish captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter spoke again:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know if you know this part of the country at
all. When we round that point just ahead, you will see
one of the strangest fjords all round the coast, though that’s
saying a good deal. Rocks sticking up out of the sea, sharp
as needles some of them, and some all tumbled about in
groups; some look like houses, and there are a few that make
gateways, as it were, real arches, that you can take a ship
through if you like.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then we shall be in very soon, I suppose—and up to time
for once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The little Dane drew himself up stiffly, glanced coldly at
Ormarr, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Begging your pardon, sir, my ship is always up to time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then, it is I who must ask your pardon, Captain
Jantzen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Always excepting pack ice and being hung up by a gale,”
added the captain in a milder tone. “Otherwise, I admit
you’re right about being up to time generally—my ship’s
an exception, that’s all. I put it plainly to the owners:
either give me a time-table that I can keep to, or find another
skipper. It’s a point of honour with me, as you might say.
As a matter of fact, there was another Iceland boat once
came into port on the day fixed—only it was just a month
late.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain laughed at his own jest, and Ormarr joined in.
Then Captain Jantzen went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Really, you know, it is a shame that there should be such
a wretched service of steamers in these waters. There are
several companies, I know, but they simply agree that there’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>no sense in competition, so they keep up freights, and run
their ships as they please. You may often have to wait
weeks for a boat, and then find the sailing’s cancelled for
some reason or other. Yes, there’s a chance for a man with
energy and capital, that’s certain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr started at the other’s words; it was as if a mist
faded from before his eyes; here before him was a chance to
redeem himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to the captain and looked at him searchingly;
a good man, by the look of him, and with determination in his
face. Suddenly he noticed that the man lacked one finger
on his left hand—strange, Abel Grahl too had lost a finger.
The coincidence seemed to form a bond between himself
and the captain. Fate, perhaps—why not?</p>

<p class='c004'>He shook his head, smiling at himself for the superstition.
Nevertheless, he asked the captain:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ever taken a turn with Fate, Captain Jantzen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain smiled, a mirthless smile that might have been
a setting of his teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should think so,” he said, with an air of definite certainty,
as if answering question about a harbour he
knew blindfolded. “And if you haven’t, I’ll give you a bit
of advice: take it by the horns straight away; don’t wait on
the defensive, attack at once. There’s this about it: when
luck favours a man, and he’s sound enough not to get spoiled
by it at once, sure enough, Fate will try to get a foot on his
neck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stretched out his left hand towards Ormarr, showing
the index finger missing, and went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It cost me that. I was a deck hand on a fishing-boat at
the time, though I knew the sea, and had many a rough turn
with it, and saved more than one from drowning. And
that’s a thing the sea won’t forgive. One day I was alone
on the foredeck, getting the anchor ready, when there was a
hitch in the cable. And then a thing happened that I’ve
never known before or since—my feet slipped sheer away
from under me, as if some one had pulled them. I came
down headlong, and the anchor tore away to the bottom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the sea, taking me with it. My finger was caught between
two links of the cable—there was no getting it free. I
thought to myself, ‘Not this time, anyway,’ and managed to
get at my knife, and hacked it off. It didn’t seem to hurt
much while I was in the water—but when I came up—the
men—believe me or not, as you will, but they started back
when they saw my face. I hurried down below—I had a sort
of feeling what it was. And I tell you, sir, there was the
mark of death in my face when I looked; the mark Fate
puts on a man before handing him over. And it was twenty-four
hours before it passed off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Jantzen laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Since then, Fate’s left me alone. Maybe she never found
out how I’d cheated her. And if she has forgotten, why,
maybe I shall live to be an old man after all.” And as if
repenting his levity, the little captain became serious once
more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All the same, it’s not right to joke about that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had listened with interest to the captain’s story.
When he had finished, he was silent for a moment, then asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long have you been captain of ‘Bjørnen,’ Captain
Jantzen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, it’ll be twelve years this spring.” And in a tone
of some resignation he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not likely I’ll have her for another dozen years.
Though I’d like to. She’s a fine boat, and somehow we sort
of belong to one another. But the owner’s getting on now,
and his health’s not what it might be. And no sons. I fancy
the other shareholders are not quite pleased with things as it
is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr walked up to the captain, and looking straight at
him, asked abruptly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What about buying them out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jantzen started, and looked inquiringly at Ormarr.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well—yes, I dare say. It’s a limited company. The
biggest shareholder is the owner—and if any one were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>buy up all the other shares on the quiet, well, there’s no
saying....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and the captain seemed suddenly to have become
remarkably intimate with each other—so, at least, it seemed
to the others on board.</p>

<p class='c004'>They remained for a long time in the captain’s cabin, bending
over a map of Iceland, discussing routes, tariffs, and
traffic in a half-whisper. They talked of nothing but how
many vessels and what size would be needed if one company
were to take over the whole of the goods and passenger traffic
between Iceland-Denmark, Iceland-Norway, and Iceland-Great
Britain.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was late when Ormarr shook hands with the captain
and went to his bunk, with the parting words:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then the first thing you have to do is to buy up all the
shares on the market. After that, get the old man to sell his
holding—but to me and no one else!”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>The following morning, Ørlygur à Borg was standing on
the borders of his land, deep in thought. He had dreamed a
strange dream the night before, and was trying hard to
remember the details. One thing only stood out plainly in
his memory. He had been standing on this very spot, a
little hill just outside Borg, one day towards the end of summer.
And there he had fought—with what, he could not
say. But it was against something stronger than himself,
something which would overpower him unless Ormarr, his
son, came to his aid. Then suddenly he had seen a viking
ship rounding the point, steering straight up the fjord. The
sight of the vessel gave him new strength; he knew that
Ormarr was coming to help him, and the ship was sailing
faster than any he had ever seen.... Here the dream had
ended abruptly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur stood on the hill, trying hard to recall more of
the vision. As if to aid his memory, he looked out in the
direction of the fjord....</p>

<p class='c004'>A steamer was rounding the point.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg lost no time; he ran to the stables, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>saddled his horse. He was about to saddle another in addition,
but checked himself—possibly it was only an important
message. Anyhow, instead of mounting, he had a sleigh
brought out, and drove off towards the snow-covered valley
at full speed, reaching the trading station just before
“Bjørnen” came in.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was not a little surprised to find his father among
the crowd of people gathered on the shore. Most of those
present had recognized Ormarr where he stood on the bridge,
and there was a general surprise at his appearance. No one
had expected him. Only his father seemed to regard his
homecoming as natural, and showed no sign of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was in high spirits and full of pleasant anticipation;
he shook hands right and left. Ørlygur found it hard
to conceal his emotion at the meeting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr introduced Captain Jantzen to his father, but the
latter spoke only a few words to the captain; he seemed
intent on getting home without delay, where he could have
his son to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before taking his seat in the sleigh, Ormarr took the captain
aside:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remember,” he said, “you must get everything ready
beforehand. First of all, a detailed scheme and tariff rates,
for our calculations. I shall be here all winter. After
that, I am going to England and France, to get the money.
I shall get it, never fear. Anyhow, I shall see you next summer
in Copenhagen. And then we can set to work in earnest.
Be ready for a struggle when the time comes—it will take
some doing, but we can do it. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c004'>On the way out to Borg, the horse was allowed to choose
its own pace; father and son were too engrossed in their talk
to trouble about anything else.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur could not quite understand his son’s attitude towards
music and fame—possibly because Ormarr himself
was loth to lay bare all the trouble of his mind. Moreover,
he felt a different man already, far healthier in mind and
body, after the last few days, as if separated by a wide
gulf from the Ormarr who had left Copenhagen after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>scandal at the Concert Hall, a broken man, to seek rest and
idleness in his own country.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur could not altogether grasp his son’s changed
attitude towards the question of his musical career, which had
cost ten years of his life and several thousand pounds. But
he thoroughly understood and approved of his new plan for a
better and cheaper and more reliable service of steamers
between Iceland and abroad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr pointed out the advantage of having an independent
national steamship service, and Ørlygur at once perceived
the possibilities of the scheme for furthering the development
of Iceland commerce and industry. The idea of excluding
other countries from participating here appealed to him,
and gained his entire support for the scheme. The very
thought thrilled the old chieftain’s heart. Ay, they deserved
no better, those slack-minded, selfish traders—they would
only be reaping the results of their own shortcomings. They
should no longer be allowed to monopolize trade, send up
prices, make unreasonable profits, and do what they liked
generally. There would be an end of their ill-found, ramshackle
vessels, coming and going at their own convenience
without the slightest regard for the public or their own advertised
times. It was war—and he rejoiced at it. No question
but that the people of Borg must win in the end.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they were nearing home, Ormarr said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am going to stay here this winter, father, before I set
out again—Heaven knows how long it may be before I come
back after that. I should like to live to enjoy one more spring
here in Iceland. But after that, I must go abroad; work,
work. It will take best part of the summer, I reckon, to
raise the money—it will need a lot of money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur gazed thoughtfully at the landscape, and answered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well—I suppose you are right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while no sound was heard but the beat of the horse’s
hoofs and the creaking of the sleigh. Then Ørlygur said in a
half-whisper:</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—we have some money here, you know, ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Ormarr looked at his father keenly, and after a moment’s
thought he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here, father, I will tell you what I have thought
of doing about the money part of the business. I want to get
the money without offering shares. It will be difficult, I
dare say. But I must be independent here; I cannot bear to
be bound by considerations of credit, or other men’s interests,
and that sort of thing. It would spoil the whole thing.
The business must be my property; I will not have a thing
that can be ruined by others after I have built it up. But
if I should be unable to get the capital in the way I want it—why,
then, I may come to you. Provided, of course, I
can be sure of running no risk in the investment. I owe
you too much already.—My inheritance, you say? I have
not come into the property yet. But suppose we put it that
way; that I owe so much to the estate. Anyhow, I owe it; it
is money that must be paid, if things do not go altogether
against us. For the present, I must fall back on you. But
I shall not want much—nothing like what I have been drawing
up to now. And I am proud that you are willing to
help me, when I know I must have disappointed you by what
I have done up to now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I trust you, Ormarr,” his father said. “I do not quite
understand, but I feel sure you were obliged to act as you did.
The rest does not concern me. I know that you are honest
and sincere, and I know that your aim now is not a selfish
one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a time no more was said; both men seemed anxious to
let it appear that their minds were occupied with anything
rather than with each other. But for all his apparent calmness,
Ormarr was overwhelmed with gratitude to his father;
to the fate that had given him such a father; given him Borg
for his inheritance, and suffered him to be born a son of this
little nation. Ørlygur, on his part, concealed beneath an
expression of indifference a feeling of pride and love for his
son.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the sleigh drove up in front of the house, all the servants
came out to welcome Ormarr, with a heartiness that showed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>plainly enough for all their quiet manner. A tall girl of
about thirteen, with lovely flaxen hair flowing loose about her
shoulders, appeared; this was Gudrun, a daughter of Pall à
Seyru, now adopted by Ørlygur. Ketill was nowhere to be
seen; Ormarr asked where his brother was.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you forgotten already? I wrote you in my last
letter that I had sent him to the school at Rejkjavik. He
wants to enter the Church, I understand. And I have been
thinking that it would not be a bad idea later on, if he took
over the living here. If, then, you decide to live abroad, as
seems likely, and give up the estate here, then he could manage
that as well. For the present, I have my health and
strength, and hope to look after it myself for many years.
We shall see.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Of Ormarr’s stay at Borg that winter there is little to be
said. Every Sunday the people of the parish came up to
hear him play the violin. He was delighted to play to them,
and touched at their grateful, almost devotional, reception of
his playing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Spring came. The snow melted, and the rivers sent floods
of muddy water and blue ice towards the sea. A great unrest
came over Ormarr, and he left earlier than he had planned.
So, after all, he missed the soft purity of the Iceland spring,
the beautiful white nights with the glow of light on the
fields and ridges pearled with dew. He missed the sight of
the butterflies fluttering in gaudy flocks, and the birds among
the little hillocks where their nests lay hid.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had already felt the grip of spring at his heart when
he saw the wild swans and other fowl heading for the still
frozen heights farther inland, driving their wedges through
the air, and crying aloud in joy of life. And that same
viking spirit which had driven his fathers before him came
on him now and drove him abroad in haste.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he left Iceland for the second time, his father stood
on the pier with moist eyes. Ørlygur remained there, watching
till nothing was to be seen of the vessel but a few grey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>wisps of smoke. Then he tore himself away, mounted his
horse, and rode home, deep in thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>If his blessing carried any weight, then surely matters
would go well with his son.</p>

<p class='c004'>He slept but ill that night; he was sorry he had not prevailed
upon Ormarr to accept the money from him. It would
have saved much trouble, and, at any rate, a certain amount
of time.</p>

<p class='c004'>If only Ormarr had come to him, rather than procure the
funds he needed from others, and upon doubtful terms....</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The cold, pure light of an autumn morning found the
electric lamps still burning in a villa by the Sound.
It was the residence of Ormarr Ørlygsson, company
director, a man well known in the business world, and
bearer of sundry decorations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The light shone through the rose-coloured curtains of the
French windows opening on to a verandah facing the sea.
The room was large; the arrangement marked its owner as
a bachelor. It served as office, sitting-room, and study. The
wall opposite the window was occupied entirely by shelves
filled with books: works of reference and lighter literature.
The other walls, each with a heavily curtained door, were
hung with paintings, all representing Icelandic landscapes.
In one corner was a heavy piece of bronze statuary, likewise
Icelandic, “The Outlaw.” The floor was covered with an
Oriental carpet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr sat at the big writing-table, his head buried in his
hands. Lights burned in a crystal globe above his head, and
in a reading-lamp at his elbow. The glow from the green
shade of the latter, blending with the light of day, created a
weird effect.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had been sitting at his desk the whole night, going
through piles of accounts and business papers.</p>

<p class='c004'>For some time he sat thus, motionless. When at last he
looked up, it was plain that thirteen years of work as a business
man had left their mark on him. His face was thinner;
his dark, rough hair was longer than was customary among
men on the bourse, and the fact gave a touch of independence
to his otherwise faultless appearance.</p>

<p class='c004'>His expression was changed; the large, dark eyes were
restless—a dreamy, far-away look alternating rapidly with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>a glance of keen alertness. When alone, his look varied
continually with his varying moods, but in the presence of
others he kept rigid control over his features; the severest
scrutiny could detect nothing of the workings of his mind.
Two deep furrows slanted down on either side the mouth,
completing the impression of resolute firmness combined with
melancholy resignation and bitterness.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he looked round the room, his eyes betrayed the trouble
in his mind. He glanced deliberately at each of the things
around him, works of art and furnishings, as if in farewell,
dwelling now and then on some single item as if trying to fix
it in his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gradually he began to realize that his first impression of
the previous day was correct—he was a stranger in his own
place. And he shuddered at the thought. Unconsciously
he picked up the cable he had received the day before,
smoothed it out before him, and read it over with bitter,
scornful eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a fool I have been!” he muttered. “I might have
known....” And he laughed—a choking, unnatural laugh,
and rose slowly to his feet. Languidly he drew back the
curtain, opened the window, and stepped out on to the verandah.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaning on the railing, he looked out over the shore, with
the troubled sea and the Swedish coast beyond. The view
had calmed him often, but there was no rest in it now; he
looked at it all impatiently, no longer able to find any comfort
in visions.</p>

<p class='c004'>All was changed now.</p>

<p class='c004'>His clothes irked him; his hands were soiled with dust from
the papers he had been busied with; a general sense of bodily
discomfort pervaded him. And as if to escape from his
emotional self, he left the room hurriedly; a bath and a
change of clothes would be something at least....</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>The housekeeper received her master’s orders to serve lunch
on the verandah with some surprise. It was a way of hers
to appear mildly surprised at things and today there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>certainly seemed some reason for astonishment: for thirteen
years her master had never been at home to a meal at that
hour of the day—why was he not at the office as usual?
Ormarr’s manner, however, forebade all questioning, and
she did not venture to ask if anything were wrong.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr went to the telephone, and rung up the office,
speaking coolly enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That you Busck? Good morning. Captain Jantzen
there? Morning, Captain.... No, nothing wrong, but something
has happened. Yes&nbsp;... listen! You must hand over
‘Bjornen’ to the first mate this voyage.... What? Lose
half an hour? Can’t be helped; I want you here. Come
out here at once, please, but first get the chief clerk to tell
you what I want done about the shares, and do as he says.
Then out here to me as quick as you can. I’ll tell you all
about it when you arrive. Right—good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A few minutes later the telephone bell rang. Ormarr took
up the receiver with a gesture of annoyance, but on recognizing
the speaker’s voice, his manner changed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes—yes. Morning, Ketill. Ill? No, not a bit. Are
you both there? Well, come out and have lunch with me
instead. Don’t know what we’ve got in the house, but come
anyway. Eh? No, not a bit. I have been rather busy—up
all night.... No, never can sleep in the daytime. Right,
then. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i>”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ketill, now getting on for thirty, was already in orders,
and was to be presented to the living of Hof in Hofsfjordur
in the autumn, Sera Daniel being about to retire on account
of age.</p>

<p class='c004'>The original plan had been that Ketill should have spent a
few days only in Copenhagen when going abroad in the
spring, on his way to Switzerland and Italy, returning <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span></i>
England. But Ketill, who had preferred staying at an
hotel rather than at his brother’s, had soon found friends,
largely owing to his brother’s introductions. One of the
acquaintances thus made was that of a banker, Vivild, whose
daughter Alma had quickly captured Ketill’s heart.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>His tour of Europe, then, came to consist of but a few
short trips, with Copenhagen as his headquarters. Ormarr
had been surprised at this, but his brother gave him no
enlightenment as to the attraction which drew him constantly
back to the capital. Until one fine day Ketill announced his
engagement and forthcoming marriage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had always looked on Alma as a tender plant, that
could never be transplanted and live; the news surprised
him. But he made no comment. Without realizing it himself,
he had been deeply in love with dainty, sweet-natured
Alma, but for no other reason apparently than a sense of his
own unworthiness, had said no word of it to her. And here
was his brother, holding the blossom himself, and tantalizingly
inviting him to admire its sweetness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The part of brother-in-law was by no means a pleasant
prospect to Ormarr, but he reconciled himself to the thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill—Sera Ketill, as we should now call him—was young
and good-looking, with a pleasant and genial bearing. At
times Ormarr could not help feeling that there was something
a trifle insincere in his brother’s geniality. Still, Ketill
was a nice enough fellow to all outward seeming, albeit a trifle
stouter of build than need be.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was never any exchange of confidence between the
two brothers; they knew, indeed, but little of each other.
Ormarr was conscious of an involuntary dislike of Ketill; he
tried in vain to subdue the feeling; it remained unaltered.
Ketill, on the other hand, appeared not to notice any lack
of brotherly love and sympathy. Neither of the two men
realized that Ketill’s nature not only did not invite, but rendered
impossible any real confidence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first to notice this, albeit but vaguely to begin with, was
Alma. The discovery troubled her a little, but she let it pass.</p>

<p class='c004'>From all appearances, the union was a promising one, and
the wedding was looked forward to by both parties with
equal anticipation. The ceremony was to take place on the
day before Ketill’s entering upon his new dignity, and the
bride was to accompany him to their new home.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma and Ketill arrived at Ormarr’s house half an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>after Ketill had rung up. Alma promptly went out to assist
the housekeeper with the lunch.</p>

<p class='c004'>The brothers, standing by the writing-table in the sitting-room,
lit their cigarettes. Sera Ketill looked with unconcealed
scrutiny at his brother’s face, and with his usual affectation
of heartiness said at once:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, if you’re not ill, you look precious near it. What’s
gone wrong now? Business?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s as you like to take it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean by that? Nothing important, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Important?—well, in a way, it is.” Ormarr passed the
wire across to his brother, who read it through.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It means that since yesterday I am—a millionaire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The devil you are—Heaven forgive me! Well, you are
in luck. How did you manage it? Can’t you tell a fellow
how it’s done? A millionaire!... Well, I’m.... Lord
forgive me! It’s all right, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, it’s right enough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well.... And What are you going to do now? Extend
the business&nbsp;... new routes?... If you take my advice,
you’ll be a bit careful. Buy up the land in Iceland—that’s a
sound investment. Buy up Hofsfjordur.... What a
lucky devil!... Lord forgive me!... But what are you
going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, anyhow, you can do things in earnest now.
Monopolize the trade of Iceland. You control the traffic
already; the people know you, and trust you—that’s worth
a lot in itself. They’re not an easy lot to win—that way, but
once you’ve got them&nbsp;... if you manage things properly,
you’re all right there. Ormarr, you’re in luck. Look at me
now—in orders. And even if I get the estate.... The old
man—father, I mean—he’s getting childish already. Gives
things away—money, live stock, food—you never saw. And
he’s struck off all outstanding debts the peasants owed him—it’s
whittling down the power of Borg to nothing. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>we ought to have kept it up. Ever since you paid back the
money you had from him—it wasn’t quite fair to me, you
know, his letting you have all that—but anyhow, since you
paid him back, he seems to think he’s a millionaire, and can
throw money about as he likes. Well, well, I’m fixed up now,
I suppose. But you—millionaire, what are you going to do
now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you.... No, it’s no use trying to explain....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, yes, go on. What is it? New speculations? I’m
interested in that sort of thing; go on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, it’s not speculation. I’ve had enough of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you believe it! When things turn out like they
have done here. To tell the truth—I’ve been thinking of a
little flutter on my own account. Old man Vivild’s put me
on to a good thing&nbsp;... but it seems you know the trick of it,
so....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, for Heaven’s sake don’t. Stick to Vivild if you’re
going in for that sort of thing. He’s a sound man, and a
clever one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well, as you please. But I can’t get over it....
A millionaire!... the dev—— Lord forgive me!”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>After lunch the three sat together in a corner of the garden—Ketill
and Alma side by side on a bench, Ormarr a little
apart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conversation flagged somewhat; a few desultory attempts
fell flat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Ormarr realized that his brother’s manner was
different when Alma was present. He had noticed something
before&nbsp;... a curious abrupt change of mood, from
lively jocularity to a sort of dreamy, thoughtful silence.
But it had never occurred to him that it was Alma that
brought about the change. Could it be a mask? In any
case, the mask, if mask it were, suited him a great deal better
than his normal appearance.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as he watched them, Alma with her brown hair and
bright dark eyes and Ketill with his heavy face and priestly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>air of calm, a feeling of resentment rose in him against his
brother.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love coming out here,” said Alma suddenly. “It’s so
different to the atmosphere at home—business.... Ugh.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill smiled. But Ormarr laughed and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should have thought one would feel more at home in the
atmosphere one grew up in. But, as a matter of fact, you
are wrong about the atmosphere here—it is all business really,
and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Father says you are not really a business man. And I
think he is right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The facts would seem to prove your father wrong, Froken
Vivild.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He says you are—extraordinary. And that you’ve a
lucky sense.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe. It comes to the same thing. I fancy success in
business is largely a matter of luck. Do you know what has
helped me most all along? Well, before I started in business,
I was well known, in a way, from my efforts in another direction.
Not to put too fine a point on it—people believed me
mad. And, consequently, everything I set out to do was
regarded as more madness. It was the best thing that could
have been—and I’m very much obliged to the people who
thought so....”</p>

<p class='c004'>A little later, Ormarr saw his guests to the gate, and stood
watching them as they left, arm in arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A lovely creature,” he thought. “The graceful way she
walks.... But a child, no more. And he—I wonder how
he will treat her. I’m afraid she will have a hard time of
it with him. Perhaps when all’s said and done, she would
have been better off with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood watching the dainty figure as it receded, noting
the graceful curves, and the mass of brown hair under the
wide-brimmed hat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A dream,” he mused. “One of life’s lovely
dreams....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He closed the gate and walked up towards the house.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“No one to stop it&nbsp;... life must run its course. <em>I</em> dare
not interfere—I may be wrong. And—in my case, it is too
late now.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>An hour later, Captain Jantzen was sitting in Ormarr’s
room, in his usual place, an arm-chair at one end of the
writing-table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr passed across a box of cigars, and rang for wine.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Jantzen was obviously ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir,” he asked, “good news, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, Jantzen; bad news.” Ormarr hunted out the telegram
he had shown Ketill, and passed it over. Jantzen read
it through hurriedly, and glanced up quickly at Ormarr.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I remember rightly, we’re on the right side here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, then—we are safe. This gives us a free hand now—we
can cover all outstanding loans, we can out-distance all
competition.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes—and it puts me out of the game, Jantzen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How? I don’t understand....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I’m afraid you’d hardly understand....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir, I confess as much. But there must surely be
something behind this—I don’t see....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only that victory has put me out of action, that is all.
Ever since I started this thing, it has only been the difficulty
of carrying it through that kept me to it. Now that is disposed
of, I collapse. I can’t live in that fruitful sort of
country where you’ve only to plough and change your crops
now and again—I can’t work at a thing that runs by itself.
It’s not only that it doesn’t interest me; I haven’t the power
of self-deception it requires. I’m perfectly aware of that.
I feel at the moment like a bow that has been strung and
drawn to its limit, and shot its bolt where it should. I’ve no
use for repetition. And, take my word for it, if luck has
favoured me up to now—in business, I mean—it would surely
fail me after this. Once before in my life I have suffered the
defeat of victory. And then, I chanced on you—it was Fate
that led me to a new task; and with it, at the end, a new victory—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>new defeat. True, the result has been somewhat
different this time. But it comes to the same thing. I have
done with the task—or it has done with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jantzen watched the speaker’s face intently; he remembered
the pale features of a younger man, who had stood
with tears in his eyes, on the bridge of his vessel, at the first
sight of Iceland from the sea. It was a face he had come to
love—so strong it could be at times, and at times so weak.</p>

<p class='c004'>And a deep despondency, such as he had only known in
lonely watches far at sea by night, filled his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was absolutely calm and unmoved to all appearances;
he seemed to have no regrets. He emptied his glass
and nodded to Jantzen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s no harm done, that I can see. What do you say
to taking over the management yourself, Jantzen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible. I could never look after a business like that—I’m
not built for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonsense, Captain. Don’t tell me you couldn’t run a
line of steamers. The idea! I suppose the truth of it is
you’re unwilling to give up your ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s true. I’ve captained ‘Bjørnen’ now for five-and-twenty
years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the business is more important than a single vessel.
Let’s stick to the matter in hand—the business itself. I
can no longer manage it myself. And you are the only man
I can trust to take over. You must take it over. As for
‘Bjørnen’—we can easily find another man. But if the business
itself were now to pass into the hands of strangers, all
our work will have been in vain; we should, in fact, have done
more harm than good.—I suppose you will say that it is
my duty to carry on. That’s reasonable enough—as long
as the course you propose is possible. But it is not possible
any longer. It is simply this: I can control myself only to
a limited degree; that you may take for a simple fact. And
the limit is reached. What I am to do now I do not know.
First of all, I shall go home—it is long since I was there.
Anything in the shape of rest, or interruption, is dangerous
to me, and that is why I have not been home to see my father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>for thirteen years. But something tells me that he needs me
now, though I have no idea in what way I can be of use.
Never mind. I am subject to my instincts; to defy them
would be a crime against myself—perhaps against a higher
power. We are both of us somewhat superstitious, you and
I. Anyhow, to come to the point. You, Captain Jantzen,
will now acquire this business by purchase.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Purchase? Now you are joking. I might perhaps
<em>manage</em> the business, if there’s no other way....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That won’t do. You must buy it outright. As to terms,
I shall be your only creditor, and you won’t find me a hard
one to deal with.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—by that arrangement, the management—the business
itself—will be in Danish hands.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you learn your trade, Captain? On the coasts
of Iceland—working for a people not your own. And you
will admit that you have more than a little sympathy with
that little island and its people, obstinate though they may be
at times. Also, it would be a good thing for my countrymen
to realize that they need not always look upon the Danes as
enemies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr took up his glass. “Well, here’s to the venture!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Jantzen’s hand trembled slightly, and he spilt a
few red drops on the costly carpet as he drank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Since you will have it so, why, let it be. But I’m sorry
about ‘Bjørnen.’”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>One evening towards the end of summer, two people
were seated in the room at Borg which served
Ørlygur as bedroom and sitting-room. They were
an old man, grey-haired and stooping, and a pale-faced young
woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last few years had left their mark on Ørlygur à Borg.
The stately bearing and alertness which had distinguished
him in days gone by, had given place to a listlessness and an
expression of gloom. There was little of the old masterfulness
in the man who sat now on the edge of the bed, staring at the
ruddy flicker of a tallow candle. His eyes were no longer
keen and bright, but dull and spiritless, as at the present
moment, or at times wandering anxiously, as if seeking aid
against some threatening peril.</p>

<p class='c004'>The young woman seated near him was finely built, with
a wealth of flaxen hair, but seemed in ill-health and troubled
in mind. Her whole bearing was one of resignation and despair.
Her eyes were red with weeping; dark rings showed up
beneath them from the pallor of her cheeks—the signs of
restless nights and sad thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Twelve strokes from the big upright clock broke the silence,
and startled Ørlygur from his musings. He glanced at the
bowed form of the woman, and then at a letter which lay on
the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more he conned the sentence which had brought such
pain to himself and his adopted daughter—as if to make sure
there had been no mistake. No, it was right enough: “I
am engaged to a girl I met here this summer&nbsp;... Alma&nbsp;... daughter of.... Married in a fortnight, just before I
leave, so you can expect us both....”</p>

<p class='c004'>The letter was from his son Ketill.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>And there, before him, sat the woman that same Ketill had
ruined—and her state would soon be evident to all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some time back the girl’s pale face and mournful bearing
had moved Ørlygur to question her, and he had learned the
cause from her own mouth. Runa, as she was called by all
on the place, was at least as deeply attached to Ørlygur as
to her real father, Pall à Seyru. And it had not been difficult
for her to confide in him. The truth had come as a terrible
shock to the old man, but both had consoled themselves with
the thought that Ketill at least had no intention of leaving
her thus betrayed; that he would behave as an honourable
man. If not—why, Ørlygur would see that he did so.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now, all unexpectedly, that consolation was destroyed,
leaving a dark future indeed ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa’s trouble was not the only thing he had to bear; there
were other matters that seemed to bode no good. And all
were more or less connected with his son Ketill; Ketill, who
was to inherit the estate and maintain the honourable traditions
of Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>To begin with, things had looked well enough; excellent,
indeed, in every way. The estate had grown richer since
Ormarr had repaid the loans made to him, and the whole trade
of the district was in the hands of Ørlygur’s trusted men.
The place was flourishing—thanks largely to Ørlygur’s magnanimity
in cancelling debts that proved too much of a burden—and
the general state of affairs was healthy and promising.
Then, in addition to the good name which Ketill would inherit,
there was his position in holy orders. Altogether, the
outlook for the family was one of dignity and honour.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, things looked otherwise. Some months before,
Ørlygur had begun to learn something of Ketill’s true nature;
his selfishness and meanness; to hand over the estate to him
seemed less advisable now than he had thought. Still, it
should doubtless be possible to make him realize the duties
and responsibilities of his position; to persuade him on
matters where any danger threatened.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the new development had raised an issue of a far more
serious character. Once it were known abroad that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>master of Borg—as Ketill in time would be—had deliberately
ruined a young girl,—a girl, moreover, under the protection
of his father’s roof,—and had thereafter married another,
probably for selfish considerations also, then the good name
of the family, jealously guarded and built up through centuries,
would be destroyed as by a flood. It seemed as if the
fortunes of Borg were on the verge of ruin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur thought of these things—and the idea of disinheriting
Ketill, at any rate as regarded succession to the estate,
crossed his mind. If only he himself could be sure of living
long enough, then he might perhaps make Runa or her child
his heir. The child would after all be his own grandchild,
with the blood of his race in its veins.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as he sat, his thoughts and plans faded to mere dreams
and aimless desires. The future was too hard for him to face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa sat trying to pray, her lips moving without a sound,
to frame the opening sentence of the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man she had loved was far away in a foreign land—at
that very moment, perhaps, he held another woman in his
arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our Father....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had sworn that he loved her. Neither had spoken of
marriage—she had not spoken of it because she had never
doubted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our Father which art....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had never written to her—not a line. It was a cruel
blow to her to realize that he had never loved her—and yet
she bore within her the seed of life he had planted. And her
whole future now was ruined and desolate....</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our father....”</p>

<p class='c004'>But she could not pray. A flood of thoughts streamed into
her mind—memories of mild spring evenings in the past and
fears for her present position in one confusion. Her brain
could not set either prayer or thought into form.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur rose and came over to her; he tried to comfort her,
but found no words. One thing only he knew: reparation
must be made, at whatever cost.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill was far from pleased to learn that his brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>was returning to Iceland on the same boat with himself and
his bride. Something told him that it would be to his interest
to keep his father and Ormarr apart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill had come to regard himself as heir to the estate by
this time, and already saw himself installed at Borg. He
never dreamed that Ormarr’s present journey, which he regarded
as merely a flying visit, could prove in any way a
danger to himself and his plans. Ormarr had told him
nothing of the transfer of the business. At the most, thought
Ketill, it would be a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c004'>His elder brother was in many ways much like his father.
Both seemed eternally to regard themselves as owing a duty
to all and sundry—simply because they happened to have been
born in better circumstances than most of those around them.
Ketill thought himself sufficiently a man of the world to be
able to destroy this conviction; and he was not far from
regarding it as a childish weakness on the part of Ørlygur and
Ormarr. Regard for others, indeed!</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill was not hampered severely by trammels of faith or
morality. He had gone to a school where the general rule of
conduct seemed to be each for himself; his studies at college
had brought him among students who for the most part made
little attempt to conceal the fact that they made light of their
calling. One after another, he had seen them go out into the
world as priests, in the service of God, spiritually defective,
rotten, and corrupt, to their task of leading others by the
right way. And all this had left him with but little respect
himself for his mission; he enrolled himself with the rest, as
a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c004'>His latest idea was nothing less than to buy up the whole
of Hofsfjordur. To own a whole parish—it would be a
position of unique power and authority. Priest and sole
landlord of the place. And then he could take over the business
now run by Jon Borgari’s widow under Ørlygur’s supervision.
It was a dazzling scheme.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was enraged when he heard that his father had cancelled
the debts owing to him by the peasants. Carefully handled,
they would have made a splendid weapon. And he puzzled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>his brains for some way whereby he might—when his father
had gone—render the old chieftain’s action null and void.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr’s return now was a serious blow to his plans. He
had more than once hinted to Ormarr that Ørlygur was getting
strange in his manner and actions of late, and it had been
in his mind that afterwards he could break the sad news to his
brother that their father had towards the end been not altogether
responsible for his actions.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now Ormarr would see his father for himself, and there
was no prospect of carrying out that part of the plan. Moreover,
it was likely that Ormarr and Ørlygur, in their talks
together, might bring out several little matters not at all to
his advantage, and seriously damage his prospects. He must,
at all events, try as far as possible to be present whenever the
two seemed disposed to talk over things generally. He had,
of course, given orders for the vicarage to be set in order
ready for his arrival, but he could doubtless stay under his
father’s roof for a time on his return, without giving cause
for comment.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr’s arrival with the newly married couple was
altogether unexpected. Ørlygur was greatly moved, and
embraced his son with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was deeply touched when he saw how his father
had aged. He thanked the Fate that had led him to throw
up his work and come home. Also, it seemed that his coming
was well timed; for he was quick to note the strained relations
between his father and Ketill, though the reason was not at
first apparent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur received his younger son with marked coolness,
but spared no pains to make his welcome as cordial as possible
to his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill’s idea of making a stay at Borg to begin with was
promptly shattered. Ørlygur had guessed his intention, and
soon after the midday meal, went out himself to see that horses
were saddled. On re-entering the room, he acquainted Ketill
of the fact, and added: “You will want to show your wife
over the new home before it gets dark.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The hint was too direct to be disregarded; there was nothing
for it but to go with a good grace.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the pair had left, Ormarr and his father sat alone in
the sitting-room. And now for the first time Ormarr perceived
how troubled in mind the old man was. He paced up
and down the room, and for some time Ormarr forbore to
question him. It was hard for Ørlygur to commence, but at
length he pulled himself together, and spoke in a weak and
faltering voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr, you should have been my only son. It would
have been better so. I am paying dearly for my disregard
of the warning. Had I not been so self-willed, maybe your
mother would have been alive now, and your life would have
been very different. Not that I’ve anything to reproach you
with, no....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr grasped his father’s hand, and pressed it. The
old man turned his head away, and went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is hard to see a thing one had treasured with heart and
soul brought to ruin; to die, and leave an inheritance of
responsibility behind. Ormarr, do you remember Pall à
Seyru’s little girl?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Runa? Yes, indeed. Why have I not seen her this time?
I hope she is not very seriously ill?” Ormarr had inquired
after her on his return, but had simply been told that she was
not well.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur hesitated for a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Runa has been betrayed—by your brother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr started as if struck, and his face paled. His
father’s hand slipped from his grasp, and the two men sat
for a while in silence. When at last they spoke, it was of
other things.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Ørlygur thoughtfully, “there are many things
that will trouble me if the estate goes to Ketill. I have an
idea that he thinks of collecting the debts I wrote off for the
people here some time back, as still due to the estate. The
folk do not trust him, and have certainly no love for him. If
the place—and the honour of the family—are left to him....
I could wish them in better hands.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“But I have come home now, father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked questioningly at his son.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—you will not be here very long? Your business....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have sold it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sold the fleet? To whom?” Ørlygur flung out the question
with evident anxiety in his voice, and looked keenly at
his son.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To Jantzen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah—that is another thing. You can trust him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As I could myself, or you, father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought so, or you would not have sold to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had to sell out, because we had succeeded in our aim,
and there was no longer any need for me to continue. I could
not go on. Once I have mastered a thing, when the element
of uncertainty and contest—apart from what is obtainable
by all—has gone, then I can work at it no longer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you will take over the estate here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. That is—or will be—a task for me; something that
others could not do as well. You are old now, father, and
your last years should be lived in peace. I may be a little
strange here, at first, still, I can feel that I have come home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Father and son sat in the growing darkness without thought
of needing lights. Each wanted to know all about the other’s
life during the years since they had last been together.
Ormarr also was keenly concerned to learn about matters in
the parish, who had died and what newcomers were to be
reckoned with; there were a hundred questions to be answered.
Ørlygur, on his part, was eager to hear of his son’s doings
during those years, for Ormarr had said but little in his
letters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is nothing to tell,” he said now. “I have worked
hard—slaved at the work—beyond that, nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are yourself again now—or at least recognizable as
yourself,” said Ørlygur. “Changes there are, of course, but
mostly in your looks only. Voice, and eyes, and expression
have not changed. I have noticed sometimes you smile just
as you used to do—it is very long ago now. They have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>weary years, since your mother and you seemed so far away—sometimes
you too seemed as far off as your mother in her
grave. But I see you have been true to yourself all the time.
And I am glad you have come home. I thank you, Ormarr.
And I thank God for sending you back to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was dark now, but still no lights were lit. The house
was silent; nothing heard save when one of the two men spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>They talked on, fitfully, springing from one thing to
another. But for all their frankness and sincerity, there
was evidently something that preyed on both their minds.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last Ørlygur brought up the matter himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Worst of all is that about poor little Runa.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr rose, walked to the window, and stood drumming
with his fingers on the panes. Then, as if ashamed of having
shown feeling, he returned to his seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Runa?... Yes. No one must know what has happened.
We cannot have <em>her</em> dishonoured. For him I have no pity,
except for the sake of his wife. She is a good little soul,
father, and we must be kind to her. But Runa&nbsp;... father,
I know what I must do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was silent. A strange stillness seemed to fill the
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose you are right,” said Ørlygur at last. “There
is not any one else...?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr rose. “No, there is no one else,” he said shortly,
and he lit the lamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur took a candlestick with a stump of candle in, lit
it, and kissed his son’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-night, Ormarr,” he said quietly. “I am going to
bed now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As he passed Runa’s bed, the light fell on two wakeful,
shining eyes. Making sure that none of the others in the
room were awake, Ørlygur bent down and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t be afraid, little Runa. Ormarr has something to
say to you in the morning.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr sat on, staring at the windows, long after his father
had gone.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>His own calmness surprised him. He felt as if he were
playing himself as a pawn on the board of life—and yet he
could play—and let himself be played—willingly enough.
Neither he nor his father had considered Runa’s possible
wishes in the matter. Ormarr smiled as the thought struck
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, in any case, her honour must be saved.</p>

<p class='c004'>A drowsy weariness came over him. How empty life was,
after all! What had he, himself, got out of it in return for
all his labour? His years of work had been for the benefit
of others. But was his work of any great importance, after
all? There had been a time when he had thought only of
fame and pleasure. Then he had seen that there were other
things more worth regard. At first he had regarded the
domains of love as sacred and inviolable, but after a time
had plunged recklessly across the border. And since then
he had always regarded himself as one who could never hope
to meet with his heart’s desire, his ideal. The whole question
of love seemed one of but slight importance to him thenceforward.
And he had been occupied with other things.</p>

<p class='c004'>It all came back to him now, as he thought of his brother’s
relations with his old-time playmate, the fair-haired child
whom he had known later as a tall, bright-spirited girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now he was to marry her. She was a woman now—and
his brother had betrayed her. It was a thing that had
to be, for her honour’s sake and that of the family name.
His brother’s child would be brought up as his. He was
to marry, and his wife would bear a child—another’s
child.</p>

<p class='c004'>How strangely the threads of life were woven! Well, after
all, why not? It mattered little—nothing really mattered.
What would the child be like? he wondered. Boy or girl?
And what was the mother like? Again, it did not matter
much.</p>

<p class='c004'>Anyhow, this must be the last phase—the final stage of his
life. It must end as it had begun—at Borg. Like his forefathers,
he was fated to be a link in a chain, rather than an
individual.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Only it meant now that all his dreams of something greater
and better were at an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced up and saw that it was light outside; the moon
had come out from behind a hill. Moved by a sudden impulse,
he took his hat and coat and went out.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sky was cloudy, semi-darkness and bright moonlight
alternating in quick succession; the earth looked cold and
forbidding under a heavy frost, with the streams showing
up as dark lines through the white.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr took a path he knew, leading to Borgara, where
as a lad he had guarded the wool by night. Leaning against
a rock, he stood, letting thoughts and fancies play through
his mind at random. The happenings of the day, the revelations
he had heard, seemed more like a dream than any reality.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Runa lay wakeful long through the night. Ormarr’s
unexpected return had thrown her into a state of confused
emotion. The simultaneous arrival of Ketill seemed but of
minor importance, though why this should be so, she could
not have told herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>She remembered Ormarr from his last visit home, and how
she had felt drawn to him at the time. He, on the other hand,
had not paid much attention to her, and was doubtless unaware
of the impression he had made. To her, he was the
greatest and best, the most wonderful of men; an ideal, inaccessible,
but nevertheless to be worshipped.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he had gone away—vanished as suddenly as he had
come, to live thenceforward only as a dream in her heart.
And she was firmly convinced that he had never given her
a thought. In this, as a matter of fact, she was right.</p>

<p class='c004'>On learning of his arrival now, she had tried in every way
to avoid him, to conceal herself from him. All the others
might know, but Ormarr—no, that was too cruel. And now—he
would learn it soon enough. His father would tell him,
and he would know what she was—the very thought of it
made her shudder. She was not what she appeared to be;
she was nothing. She hated Ketill, and wished herself dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>The thought of taking her own life had crossed her mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>but fear restrained her. Now the thought came up again,
and when Ørlygur had whispered to her as he passed, whispered
a thing she dared not understand, she made up her
mind. There was no fear in her heart now, she had taken her
decision.</p>

<p class='c004'>Shortly after Ørlygur had retired, she rose up, dressed
herself noiselessly, and crept along the passage towards the
room where Ormarr slept. A light showed from beneath
the door; evidently he was still awake. With bated breath
she passed by, and crept from the house without a sound.
She longed to look in through the window, just to see what
he looked like—now. But she dared not risk it. She stepped
cautiously and quietly until a little way from the house, then
suddenly she broke into a run, and made away towards the
place she had in mind....</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr saw a woman come rushing down towards the river.
His first impulse was to run towards her, but, realizing that
she must pass close by where he stood, he remained motionless,
waiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman checked her pace and stood for a moment with
hands clasped to her breast. Then she bent down and, taking
up one of the sacks that were strewn around, began filling it
with stones. She felt its weight, and, apparently satisfied,
tied up the mouth. No sound came from her lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a flash Ormarr realized who it was, and what she had
in mind. He saw her move down to the water’s edge, the
sack in her hand. Then, rising, he called to her softly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Runa!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stood still as if paralysed. He walked up to her
without a word; he did not look at the sack, but touched it
as if by accident with his foot, sending it into the water.
Then, taking the girl’s arm, he led her quietly back to the
house.</p>

<p class='c004'>He took her to his room, led her to a seat and sat down
beside her, taking her hands in his and stroking them tenderly.
The girl’s breast heaved; she was deadly pale, but she made
no sound. So unexpected had been Ormarr’s intervention
that she had hardly realized as yet what had happened.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Ormarr held her hands in his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor child, it is hard for you, I know. Life is hard. I
have learned something of that myself. Poor child, poor
child! But, Runa, you must trust me&nbsp;... will you try?
I will be kind to you. Perhaps, after all, you may be glad
of the child and I as well. For we must marry, you know;
it is the only thing to do. But only as a matter of form, of
course, to save a scandal. The child will be born in wedlock,
and it will be understood to be mine. No one knows anything
as yet; we can go abroad at once, and stay away a year or so.
It is not what you had wished for, I know, not what you had
a right to expect, but—there is no other way now. As far as
<em>he</em> is concerned it is too late.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa burst into tears, and sat weeping silently, with
scarcely a movement of her face; but her breast heaved
violently, and the tears poured down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know, dear child, it is hard for you; you love him, and
me you neither know nor care for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl drew back her hands and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hate him,” she said, almost in a whisper. And a moment
after, she added passionately, defiantly. “And I never
loved him at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She threw herself face downwards over the table, sobbing
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr left her to herself for a while. Then going over
to her, he stroked her hair, and tried to comfort her, as one
would with a child. And when she looked up, there was a
light in her eyes, of gladness, as when a child meets kindness
from one it loves and respects.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tears rose to Ormarr’s eyes; the thought crossed his mind
that she might at that moment be wishing the child were his.
And a pang of vague longing passed through him, such as he
had known at times when life had seemed empty for the lack
of one thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>As if by one accord, the two avoided each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then resolutely Ormarr threw off his shyness, as if it were
a thing to be ashamed of. He went straight to her, and spoke
as calmly as he could—though his voice quivered a little.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Runa, there is nothing else to be done. You must be my
wife.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she answered. There was nothing of bitterness
or regret in her voice. But she fell to crying again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then said Ormarr: “You will be mistress of Borg, you
know, and that means a big responsibility, and much to look
after.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She had stopped crying now, and was evidently listening,
though she still hid her face. Ormarr went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have finished my work abroad now. When we come
back from our journey, we shall take over the management
of Borg. Father is old, and needs rest. And then it will be
for us to see that our child is so brought up that we can leave
the place in good hands after us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa sat for a while without speaking; she had stopped
crying now. Then she rose, and carefully dried her eyes to
leave no sign of weeping, and murmured something about it
being time for her to go. And then tears came into her eyes
again, and she blushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had opened the door, but closed it again and came
towards her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” he said, “don’t you think we might shake hands
and consider it settled? That is, unless you would rather
have time to think it over? We could at least promise to
give each other the best we can....” Ormarr could hardly
speak, so deeply was he moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa gave him her hand—a warm, trembling hand. He
pressed it, and let her go.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the door had closed behind her, Ormarr began slowly
undressing, thinking aloud, as was his wont.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If life is really only a tiny meaningless flicker, and death
the eternal and constant state, if life is only little indifferent
momentary things, and death the great and boundless, then
why all this complication and suffering? If my soul could
perish, could be destroyed by suffering like the smoke of
wood consumed by fire, like the scent of a flower shed out into
space, like a colour that fades in strong sunlight, then it
would surely have become disintegrated long since. Or are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>we all figures on a stage? If there were any connecting
string between myself and the gods above, I fancy I should
make a first-rate marionette.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He put out the light and got into bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is just like me to try and conceal my thoughts from
my innermost self, to breathe a philosophical mist over the
windows of my own mind. If I were to be honest now, I
should have to confess something different. Be honest for
once? And confess! Confess that a new, inexplicable joy
had suddenly welled forth within me!</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just because I have seen the flush of a soul turned
towards my own. And here I am already building castles
in the air, with golden towers of great anticipation. But,
to be honest, I must build here and now, whether I will or
not, and trust that the building may stand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The moonlight shone in over him; he turned his glance
towards it and looked up smiling at the sad, wry face, nodded
to it, and then turned over on his side and fell asleep.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER I</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Fru Alma had come to Iceland knowing nothing of
the language of the country. Ketill and his brother
had always spoken Danish; it had never occurred to
her that all Icelanders might not understand it.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she came to Borg on her first arrival, and met her
father-in-law, who could neither understand her nor speak
to her, she realized that this ignorance on her part would
make her lonely and isolated, and she asked her husband:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you not teach me Icelandic, Ketill?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Ketill answered curtly. He was in ill-humour on
account of the failure of his first plans, and his reception
generally.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never thought of it,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma, whose womanly instinct had told her at once that
all was not as it should be among the family, glanced anxiously
from one to another of those round her. Then she
observed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I can’t talk to any one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can talk to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma was silent. It was the first time her husband had
spoken unkindly to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later on, as they went home to Hof, Ketill rode in silence,
with never a word to his wife all the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma’s heart was full of conflicting emotions. She was
sorry that there should be any coolness between herself and
her husband; but her conscience at least was clear. And
why could he not talk to her; tell her what it was that evidently
troubled him? It struck her that he had never really
confided in her, save in regard to matters of no account.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly she realized that they were really strangers. She
had never really known him, after all; he had never opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>his heart to her. And the distance between them seemed
so tangible that it was hard to realize that they were actually
married. Despite the intimacy of their relationship, they
were separated by a veil of darkness and uncertainty. And
so they were to live, side by side, year after year, bound one
to another by a bond that could not be broken,—ay, and by
another that would soon be evident,—to live in each other’s
company through every day. And the thought was so painful
to her that she found herself unwilling to contemplate that
her children would have to call this man their father.</p>

<p class='c004'>The change in her feelings, or more properly, her sudden
realization of the true state of things, the recognition of her
thoughtless rashness in entering upon this marriage, came to
her as something overwhelming; she hardly knew herself.
All in a moment she was changed; she was no longer the
light-hearted, innocent girl, but a creature unknown, with
unknown possibilities.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was done now, and she was helpless. She had given
vent to thoughts and feelings which, as her old self, she
would never have dreamed of. So unaccustomed was she to
act on the dictates of her own feeling and not by custom and
tradition, to measure things by her own ideas and not by
orthodox, accepted standards, that she felt herself now a
dangerous person, a criminal, forced to seek refuge in silence
and emptiness from words or thoughts that might lead to
disaster.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was her husband now, riding ahead, and paying no
heed to how she managed on the way. Where was the courteous
gentleman who had stood by her side at the altar?
And she had told herself—and others—that she had found
the ideal partner for life! A priest, moreover, a servant of
God, set in the forefront of humanity as an example to others!</p>

<p class='c004'>Little by little she worked herself up to a state of bitter
scorn. Once she had let herself go, she knew no bounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>And she did not spare herself, now that she had once ventured
to form her own judgment of things and people, herself
included.</p>

<p class='c004'>Oh, what an irresponsible fool she had been in her self-deception!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Trustful and idealistic—yes, and narrow-minded
and unwittingly a hypocrite. A doll, a child, a foolish butterfly
thing.... Heavens, how little and mean and stupid,
wicked and ridiculous, she had been—she and so many others
of her kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was her husband, riding ahead&nbsp;... yes....</p>

<p class='c004'>A reaction of regret at her impetuosity came over her. It
was a dreadful thing not to love and honour him. Oh, if
only he would make it easier; turn round and nod to her
kindly, or say a friendly word. She would be loving and forgiving
at once. Who could say what troubles were burdening
him all the time? And perhaps it was only to spare her that
he said nothing. Men were strange in that way; they fancied
that a woman suffered less in such estrangement if she did not
learn the cause of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then—oh, it was incredible! They were at the ford now,
and he was riding through the stream without so much as a
look behind him.... Well, perhaps there was nothing so
strange in that, after all; possibly it had not occurred to him
that she had never forded a stream on horseback in her life;
it was only thoughtlessness on his part.</p>

<p class='c004'>But all the same it was a hard struggle to keep her mind
in any friendly attitude towards him, or to keep back the fears
that would rise to her eyes. She bit her lips, and strove to
restrain her feelings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her horse was already knee deep in the water—and the
Hofsa at this part was wide, yet with a fairly strong current.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma had never ridden through running water before; at
first it seemed to her as if the horse had suddenly flung itself
sideways against the stream. Instinctively she leaned over
herself, farther and farther, against the stream. Ketill, a
couple of lengths in front, looked round just as she was about
to fall, turned his horse, and seized her arm just in time.</p>

<p class='c004'>The roar of the water, and a sense of dizziness in her head,
rendered her unconscious for the moment. But the grip on
her arm was hard, and a feeling of anger rose in her towards
her husband. Again she restrained herself; it was perhaps
only his firmness that had saved her; she forgot about his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>carelessness in riding ahead of her across the ford. Her
kindly feelings were uppermost, and as soon as they had
crossed to the farther bank, she turned to him, trying honestly
to speak in a friendly tone, and asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, Ketill; what is the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing—nothing,” answered Ketill, and gave his horse
a cut with the whip, so that the animal sprang forward a pace.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that, Alma broke down entirely, and fell to sobbing
helplessly; she was weary and desperate, unable to think, or
even consciously to feel; she was alone in a great solitude,
herself a solitary speck of misery in an endless expanse.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>They reached the vicarage. Alma was now in a state of
dull indifference. She had, however, carefully dried the
tears from her face, and drawn down her veil.</p>

<p class='c004'>The vicarage servants, about a score in all, had gathered
in front of the house to welcome the new master and his wife.
Ketill was abrupt and reserved as hitherto; he shook hands
with them all, as was the custom of the country, but his greeting
was cold and formal.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somewhat unwillingly, Alma laid her slight, warm hand
in the first hand outstretched towards her; but the evident
respect and kindly feeling with which it was taken touched
her at once, and she grasped it with sincere feeling. And
the ice once broken, she was able to greet each of the
simple, silent folk with unfeigned heartiness. She could not
understand their stammered words, but her own manner
spoke for itself, and one old woman, the last to come forward,
was so touched by the natural kindliness of the fine lady
from foreign parts, that she forgot herself so far as to
put one arm around her shoulder and kiss her on the
cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma felt herself trembling, and could hardly restrain
her tears. Leaning on the old woman’s arm, she passed into
the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill gave some brief orders, and the servants dispersed.
But even this first encounter had been enough to plant in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the heart of each of them a seed of ill-will towards their
master, and affection towards the Danish lady he had
brought with him as his wife.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>The old woman led Alma into the low-ceilinged sitting-room
and left her. Neither could understand the other’s
speech, and she had judged it best to retire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma sat down on a chair just inside the door, still wearing
her riding-habit and veil, and looked round the room.
It was painted white, with four heavy beams across the ceiling.
The two windows at one end of the room were already
hung with heavy winter curtains above the white. The furniture
was of polished mahogany. The floor was carpeted, and a
heavy old-fashioned stove was built into the centre of one
wall. A big upright clock ticked monotonously, with a beat
as cold and devoid of feeling as the utterance of a philosopher
whom nothing on earth could move. There was a sense
of comfort about the general atmosphere of the room, yet it
had, as is often the case with rooms antiquely furnished, a
touch of aloofness, forbidding the introduction of any other
tone, or at least dominating others by its own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Close to one of the windows Alma noticed a large writing-table
and a bookshelf; that seemed familiar. And suddenly
she realized that the room was to be not hers alone, but her
husband’s also. Probably he had no study of his own in the
house. And a feeling of bitterness crept into her heart; the
room seemed less inviting now.</p>

<p class='c004'>She rose, and crossed to the window farthest from the
writing-desk, where there stood a small work-table. Here
she sat down in an easy-chair, still without taking off her
things, and looked out of the window. Outside was a small
plot of potatoes and turnips, hedged in with the remains of
a rhubarb bed, against the high bank which sheltered the
garden on the north. The windows faced south-west, looking
on to the bleak, high field beyond the enclosure. Behind
the vicarage towered the Hof Mountains, hanging threateningly,
as it were, above the place; farther in the distance were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>blue-grey peaks and ridges. It was all so strange to her that
now, looking at it calmly, it seemed unreal, incredible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma turned cold at heart as she looked. She remembered
her first survey of the landscape earlier in the day, from Borg;
she had found nothing green in it all save the sea. All the
meadows and pastures round the house seemed withered and
grey; the autumn green of the fields in Denmark was nowhere
to be seen. All things seemed barren and decayed, with
a grey pallor, as it were, of something nearing death, that she
had seen before only in aged humanity. Here, she perceived,
autumn was a reality, and not merely a passing phase to be
taken lightly. Most of the houses, small and low, were built
of turf and stone together. And the separate buildings of
each homestead seemed to creep in close to one another, keeping
as close to the ground as possible, like a flock of animals
cowering before an approaching storm.</p>

<p class='c004'>The impression it made on her then, of impending disaster,
of something evil lying in wait, had vanished as quickly as
it had come; she had not had time to dwell on it. But
now it recurred to her mind, and she felt herself surrounded
by coldness and enmity on all sides—until she remembered
the greetings of the servants, and the old woman who had ushered
her in to the house. The kindness they had shown to her,
alone and helpless as she was, seemed like a protecting circle
round her. And easier in mind for the thought, she fell to
pondering how she could best learn their language quickly,
that she might at least find some kind words for them in return.</p>

<p class='c004'>While she was thus engaged, her husband entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>She glanced at his face; anxious first of all to learn if he
were still in the same ill-humour as before. The light was
fading, but she could see that his expression was cold and
hard, that of a stranger. Her heart beat violently; she sat
without a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill hardly gave her so much as a glance; he walked up
and down the room once or twice, as if in thought, then stood
by the window farthest from her, looking out. After a while,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>he drew a deep breath, and came towards her. His brow
was lined, and his face stern, but there appeared nevertheless
to be some attempt at friendliness in his bearing—as if to
show that she at least was not the cause of his ill-temper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well here we are, at home!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma’s heart throbbed painfully, but he did not notice her
emotion—only that she had not taken off her riding
things.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Haven’t you got your things off yet?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have not bidden me welcome yet, Ketill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I forgot. Never mind, don’t worry about that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, no.... Forgotten, did you say? Ketill, I hardly
know you again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever do you mean by that? One can’t always be
in the best of tempers, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, perhaps not. But—it seems a strange homecoming,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill was silent. He had no reply to offer, and the conversation
bored him. He was curiously indifferent to Alma’s
feeling of well-being or the reverse. What was she, after
all? A child, thoughtless, ignorant, like all women—and
most men too, for that matter. She was out of sorts just
now—never mind, she would have forgotten it by tomorrow.
At any rate, he could make it all right again then; perhaps
he might feel more in the mood for paying attention to her
troubles. Ketill was thinking in this strain when Alma spoke
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is strange that you should be so different now, all at
once. It almost seems as if our marriage had separated us
rather than brought us together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill had no time now to bother about whether there were
any truth in this or not: no, the only thing to do was to smile
in a superior fashion and not let himself be put out. And he
smiled accordingly, the self-satisfied smile of a priest and a
model husband, setting aside his bad temper for the moment,
and said:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“There, there, little philosopher—let us put off the quarrel
till another day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quarrel? Oh, I had never thought to quarrel. I’m only
unhappy, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, don’t you think it might be reasonable to imagine
that I had some reason for being—well, not in the best of
tempers today—what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed, Ketill. But you have told me nothing; I
know nothing of what could have upset you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, hardly. Women don’t understand men’s troubles
as a rule.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That seems a new sort of thing for you to say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Possibly. We’ve hardly known each other long enough
for me to have told you everything I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True, we have not known each other so very long. I only
hope we may not find we knew too little of each other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill laughed; to his mind, the question was not worth taking
so seriously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you’ve certainly grown less of a child and more
of a woman—more of a married woman—than you were.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Alma found it utterly impossible to fall in with his
tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am tired, Ketill. I should like to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Already! Well, well, perhaps it’s the best thing you
could do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked to the door, opened it, and called down the
passage: “Kata!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The old woman who had first shown Alma in, answered his
call, and Ketill charged her briefly to show her mistress upstairs;
she was unwell, and would go to bed at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Kata led her mistress to the bedroom above. She could
not overcome the awkwardness caused by the impossibility of
speech, but did her best to make up for it by kindly looks and
gestures.</p>

<p class='c004'>She would have withdrawn again at once, but Alma held
her back, made her sit down on a chair by the bed, and tried
to talk to her, repeating little phrases again and again till
they were understood. Kata seemed willing enough, and did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>her best to understand; she would have liked to explain that
she and all the others had already taken to their new mistress,
and were anxious to do all they could for her. It was a marvel
to Kata that a fine lady could be so natural and sweet and
condescending. All that she had seen before of that sort
had been proud and stiff and disdainful towards humble
folk.</p>

<p class='c004'>She tried to relate a dream she had had the night before
about a burning light washed up by the waves, on the shore
just below. Old Kata was a poor enough creature to look at,
but by no means poor in spirit. She had her own world of
visions and dreams, and was mistress there. And she would
not speak to all and sundry of her dreams; but folk knew
she had the gift, and could see what she would and learn what
she pleased.</p>

<p class='c004'>Kata was sure that the light she had seen was the <i><span lang="nn" xml:lang="nn">fylgje</span></i>,
the attendant spirit, of the young Danish lady. Kata always
saw a person’s <i><span lang="nn" xml:lang="nn">fylgje</span></i> before she encountered the person in
reality, and she had rarely seen so beautiful a <i><span lang="nn" xml:lang="nn">fylgje</span></i> as this.
For what could be more beautiful than a burning light? A
burning light in the darkness. And she was accustomed also
to interpret and say what such things meant. But here she
could not. A burning light in the darkness—what could that
mean? Something good, something beautiful it must be. And
the person it followed must be a good and lovable soul.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Later that evening, the servants sat talking things over
together before going to bed. They spoke of their Danish
mistress, and gathered round old Kata, who, of course, had
first claim to speak with authority here.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anyway, she’s a good heart,” said one of the men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And not too proud to take humble folks’ hand—as she
did my very own.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Kata let them talk; she could afford to be silent. Her
turn would surely come. She had had most to do with their
mistress up to now, and, moreover, she was recognized as the
wisest head in the place—not excepting any priest. She sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>now with her knitting, considering it beneath her dignity to
take notice of all that was said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, she had already expressed her opinion, in the
most favourable terms, and as the others likewise had nothing
but praise to utter, there was no call for her to take further
part.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anyway, I’m certain she won’t be as hard and cruel
as the last one was, with her scolding and words,” said one
of the maids. “What say you, Kata?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s the blessedest light I’ve met in all my days,”
answered Kata quietly, and a trifle slowly, as was her way.
“There’s never an evil thought in her soul, nor a hard word in
her mouth. And that’s the truth.”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Sera Ketill went late to bed that night. By ill
chance it was Saturday, and he had to have his sermon
ready for the morrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>On this occasion, above all, it behoved him to take some
pains with it. It was his first service, and there would be a
large and expectant congregation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, he did not feel at all in the mood for dealing
with his text: “Ye cannot serve two masters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt a sudden bitterness of regret that he had ever
decided to become a priest. Had he but chosen any other
profession—a lawyer, a doctor, even a trader! Then he would
have been able at least to avenge his defeats indirectly, by
letting others suffer for them. Just think, for instance, of
the satisfaction with which he could have taken up the task
of passing sentence upon some one or other, instead of pointing
out the inadvisability, nay, the impossibility, of serving
two masters. He wished he could have altered the text, and
held forth, for instance, upon the abomination of desolation,
or the Day of Judgment. But it could not be done; the text
was of serving two masters, and nothing could alter it. And
he had to have a good strong sermon on that text by tomorrow,
or his first appearance would be a failure. He was not disposed
to risk further defeats after the ill-success of his plans
today. He needed the encouragement of a victory, and must
take it where it seemed most easily attainable.</p>

<p class='c004'>He thought of his changed position; all things had turned
out badly up to now. His castles in the air; his dreams of
power—unlimited power—in the parish, had, he could already
perceive, faded into nothing. And suddenly it struck him
that he had only to give vent to his own bitterness, directing
it into the proper channel, and there was his sermon!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>It took time, and it was late before his manuscript was
finished. But as he contemplated it, noting with satisfaction
the finishing touches, he felt assured that here at least was a
masterpiece; he had only to deliver it with forceful and earnest
eloquence, and it must have its effect. He had regained
his self-control, and was ready to forget all the disappointment
of the day in sleep.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Alma awoke early next morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>She dressed in haste, and as quietly as possible, anxious not
to awaken her husband, and with some difficulty found her
way through the passages and out of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>She stood for a little outside. It was a quiet autumn day;
the air seemed full of a strange peace and solemn calm. Being
Sunday, there were none of the people astir, save those busy
within doors in stables or kitchen, and of these she saw nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma wandered round the place, making a survey of her
surroundings. The buildings, with their turf roofs and
solid walls of the same material, seemed pleasant enough to the
eye, giving a sense of security in their massive solidity. They
seemed as firmly rooted and immovable as if Nature and the
Lord had planted them in the earth when earth was made.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked about for the church, but could see none. The
tarred wooden structure yonder, with a turf wall round, could
surely not be it—and yet, on closer inspection, she noticed
a white cross rising from the roof. With a curious beating
of the heart, she hurried across to the gate in the earthen wall.
Reaching it, she found that the church stood in the middle of
a modest little churchyard. She opened the gate and went in.
Most of the graves were simply oblong mounds of earth, only
here and there was there a headstone with the usual border
round. And there were a few wooden crosses with lettering
in black tar.</p>

<p class='c004'>The church itself was locked. She walked round the outside,
and looked in through one of the windows, of which
there were three on either side. The interior was painted
white. At one end stood the altar, on a small semicircular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>eminence, with a low rail round. Next to it were the choir
stalls, consisting of a few benches along the walls and some
loose ones arranged to allow of passage between. On the
right, looking down the nave, was the pulpit, with painted
figures of apostles on the panels, evidently older than the
church itself. There was a small harmonium, polished and
new-looking—the contrast made Alma smile. But she regretted
it at once; the feeling of amusement at this primitive lack
of taste which installed a brand-new cheap-line harmonium
in an old church, disappeared. She felt that God’s all-seeing
eye was on her as she stood there spying in through a window
at His house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking around for somewhere to sit down a little, she
noticed that the churchyard wall on one side was low, and
went across. On her way she passed a grave on which stood a
small pillar of grey granite, the upper part broken off
obliquely. She stopped, and half unconsciously read the
inscription. Between the Christian name and surname stood
the word <i><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">skald</span></i>. She passed on, wondering in her mind what
the little word might mean, but gave it up, and soon forgot it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Seating herself on the churchyard wall, she let her eyes
wander over the country round, noting how the sun shone
on the fjord and on the farther side of the valley, leaving
a strip of shadow on the fjeld. And a feeling of longing
rose in her breast. It was strange to see the sun shining
on others, and herself be left in the shadow. It seemed as
if there were joy there, beyond—joy in which she had no part,
and which saddened her to watch. And it was not only
today, not merely the shadow of a passing cloud that barred
her from the sunlight; no, there stood the fjeld, the dark and
massive, rocky height, that day after day was to steal the sunlight
from her life. She felt that there was enmity between
them—but a moment later she realized that the dark church
and the gloomy fjeld were in harmony; and that God was in
and over both.</p>

<p class='c004'>Strange—ever since she had set foot in this place, she had
felt the presence of God distinctly; a blind omnipotence, of
merciless mercy—she hardly knew how to define it. God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>was not so distant in these surroundings as He had first
appeared. The snow-white sides of the fjeld were pure and
good to look upon; they might well be the abode of God. The
country itself, in all its outlines, shapes, and colours, was so
wild and unlike all else that it seemed impossible to regard
it as inhabited by human beings only, with their petty trials
and pleasures. It was impossible, here, to attach great importance
to one’s own well-being or the reverse; one felt so
pitifully small and weak. Even life and death seemed to
lose their distinctive outline.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma caught herself thinking—and she smiled at the
thought—that she had grown, and grown wiser since her
arrival, all in the space of a day and a night. She felt now,
to a degree almost beyond reason, that she was but a speck
in eternity, only a ripple on the endless sea of time.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ketill found his wife deep in thought, seated on the churchyard
wall. She had not heard him approaching, and started
when he touched her.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a sudden access of tenderness, he took her in his arms
and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She made no resistance, though she resented the action
inwardly. His strength and the physical charm of the man
that had once attracted her were now grown repulsive.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill noted that his wife looked serious. It suited her,
and he stroked her hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sitting here all alone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was just looking round the place. One could sit here
for years, I think, without getting tired of it. I wish I were
a rock—set in a place like this for ever!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill laughed. “I must say I prefer existence as a
human being,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it is lovely here,” Alma went on. “So grand and
wonderful—the rocks and the sea and the snow spreading
everywhere, and the desolate fields—barrenness and abundance
at once. It is like looking at the stars in the sky—emptiness
and yet so rich....”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“A bit of good rich pasture land would be more to my
taste,” objected Ketill teasingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose it would. Really, I think I feel more at home
here than you do yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’m glad you do not find the country altogether
forbidding. Many people do, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forbidding? I feel as if I were under a spell. No will
of my own, just a thing in the hands of Fate. And I love the
feeling that there are great and distant powers that have
taken my life into their hands.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You had better be careful, or you will be growing superstitious—it
is a common failing among the people here.
They believe in all kinds of spirits, portents, omens, fate, and
all that sort of thing. Look at that gravestone there—the one
with the granite pillar. A young poet was buried there.
Somehow the top of the stone got broken off. And folk lay
it to the charge of the powers of darkness—he killed himself,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.... A broken soul beneath a broken stone....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think the powers of darkness trouble themselves
much about the gravestones in our churchyards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A poet, you say? And he killed himself? How—why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Threw himself over the cliff into the sea. You can see
the spot—over there. It falls sheer down into the fjord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma looked and shuddered. A white wave broke the surface
of the water, and dashed against the cliff.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nobody seems to know quite. They say it was something
outside the usual causes—not starvation, for instance, or love
or weariness of life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nobody knows? And yet he threw himself into the sea?
Then it must have been a call from on high. He realized the
presence of God, and followed it, into darkness and death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Alma, whatever are you talking about!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hardly know myself. The words came into my mouth
without a thought. And I feel myself thinking strange things
that never entered my head before.” And she laughed, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>little nervous laugh. “It is as if the spirit were upon me, and
I had to speak so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Ketill suddenly felt called upon to play the priest.
Though, as a matter of fact, he was rather impressed by her
words.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Alma, that is blasphemy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at all.” She looked up in surprise. “I simply feel
as if the Spirit of God were moving on the face of the waters,
and as if I were a piece of dead clay, waiting to be created
as a human being.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>By half-past nine, the congregation began to appear, coming
up in little groups. Many were on horseback.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma was outside the house, and it seemed as if the place
had suddenly become alive. Little knots of people came into
view here and there, far or near, appearing and disappearing
between the contours of the landscape. Nearly all were
hurrying.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reaching the church, they dismounted in groups, as they
had come, tethering their horses near by. They were unsaddled,
and some were merely hobbled and allowed to wander
about at will. The churchgoers then set to tidying themselves
before the service: pulling off the long riding hose, brushing
dirt and hair from their clothes, unpacking collars or aprons,
and fastening bows with careful neatness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, having completed their toilet, they began to move
about, exchanging greetings and news, collecting in new
formations and changing again. A few spoke noisily, but
for the most part they talked in an undertone, with much
nodding of heads and brief ejaculations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma was a centre of attraction, though most of the curious
ones tried to conceal their interested observation. A
few of the principal farmers and their wives, knowing who
she must be, came up to greet her, but with some awkwardness,
when they found she could not understand their speech.
And they withdrew to the company of their fellows.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg came alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma went up to her father-in-law, who smiled and took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>her hand, flushing like a youth, and with that curious kindly
smile of his lighting up the furrowed face. He was looking
better, she thought, than he had done the day before.</p>

<p class='c004'>She took his arm, and would have led him into the house,
but he shook his head, and nodded in the direction of the
church, where the bell was now ringing in. Most of the
congregation were already seated, only a few late comers
were hastening up. Among them was old Kata. She
thought herself unobserved, and waved a coloured kerchief
in the air, muttering to herself: “Away, be off with you,
cursed creatures; get away, wicked things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The bystanders imagined she was addressing invisible beings,
evil spirits and demons,—the <i><span lang="nn" xml:lang="nn">fylgjer</span></i> of those present,—whom
she had to drive away to make a passage for herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma entered the church with Ørlygur, leaning on his arm
up the aisle. This was not customary except in the case of
bride and bridegroom, but she knew no better. Ørlygur was
somewhat embarrassed, but he felt happier than he had done
for many a day; not for any consideration would he have withdrawn
his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>He found her a seat next to his own sitting, but did not
take that place himself. As the first layman in the parish he
had duties to perform; he led the singing, and Alma noticed
that it was the organ that followed his lead, not the reverse.
She also remarked that his voice was surprisingly strong and
pure for his years.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the responses, however, he faltered a little; possibly,
thought Alma, from nervousness on account of the fact that
his son was officiating for the first time. A little after, she
noticed a frown on his brow, lines that had not been there
before, or at least not so marked. And it crossed her mind
that Ørlygur à Borg was not on friendly terms with his son
Ketill—there must be some good cause for it....</p>

<p class='c004'>Already she seemed to have grown to love this old man,
with his snow-white hair and beard, and the look of strength
and yet of Christian kindliness in his face. Her eyes wandered
from one to another of those present, old and young.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many were better dressed than Ørlygur, who wore a suit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of brown homespun material, his jacket buttoned up round
the neck, and a pair of soft hide shoes on his feet. Many of
the others wore collars and polished boots, yet it was easy to see
that this man was the leader—the born master of his fellows,
to whom all others must defer. Not that there was anything
overbearing in his manner, far from it. He nodded to one
and all, and they returned his greeting without servility, but
with ungrudging respect as towards a superior whom they
esteemed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur sat with bowed head and expressionless features
throughout the sermon. But Alma could see that the people
generally were carried away. And when the service was at an
end, they gathered round Ørlygur and Ketill to offer their
congratulations. Ørlygur, however, made no reply to their
words of praise, only thanked them briefly. Shortly after,
he took leave of Alma, shaking his head in response to her
invitation to the house. She saw him go up to Ketill, who
was standing in the middle of a group of peasants, and
address a few words to him, whereupon both men walked
away to where Ørlygur’s horse was standing.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>“Ketill, I must have a word with you,” said Ørlygur to
his son.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as soon as they were out of earshot of the rest he went
on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do not speak; do not dare to say a word! Listen! You
are a scoundrel and a rogue. Your sermon was hypocrisy,
and inspired by something certainly not divine. You can
deceive these poor folk, maybe, but you can no longer deceive
me. I cannot imagine what use the Lord has for such a man
as you—that He ever let you into His vineyard at all. And
I cannot understand what Fate ever led that angel yonder
to become your wife. How her beautiful eyes could fail to
see through you—’tis more than I can fathom. Her will
is for good—and yours for evil. Ay, you may smile! You are
a hypocrite—a ne’er-do-well. But you are the priest of this
parish, more’s the pity, and married to a good and beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>girl—also, you are my son. I can only warn you to be careful.
And I have this to tell you: Ormarr is taking over the
estate of Borg; he has sold his business. And he is to marry
Runa, my adopted daughter; they are going abroad at once.
When Ormarr dies, Borg goes to <em>their</em> children—you understand
me? I would advise you to be good to your wife.
Should I hear otherwise, then God have mercy upon you.
For her sake I will continue my duties in the church as before,
hateful though it is to me to endure the sight of you. For
her sake I pray that God will give me strength. Even now
I cannot set foot in your house. Make what excuse you please
to your wife; let her be spared from knowing the truth;
bring her to Borg occasionally yourself. I would not see her
suffer for your sins. And now I have spoken my mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg turned on his heel, mounted his horse, and
rode off.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill had endeavoured once or twice to smile during
his father’s outburst, but it was more for the sake of preserving
his self-control that he had tried to consider the matter in a
humourous light. As Ørlygur rode away, he stood with
bowed head, set teeth, and frowning brow; then with an effort
he pulled himself together, striving to regain his normal air
of priestly authority.</p>

<p class='c004'>When, a few minutes later, he encountered Alma, he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father was very busy, and could not come in. He
told me to give you his kind regards. Ormarr is leaving tomorrow—going
abroad, so they have much to do at Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So that is why Ormarr did not come to church?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, naturally.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But surely he will come and say good-bye?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is hardly likely. He is only going away for a short
time, and when he comes back he will live at Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be nice to have him so near. But what about his
business?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has sold it, so my father tells me. As a matter of
fact, this voyage is a sort of honeymoon. He is going to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>marry Runa, father’s adopted daughter, and she is going
with him. We did not see her yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it seems strange—not to pay a farewell visit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill smiled sarcastically. “I should not expect it,” he
said. “It is not the custom in this country.”</p>

<div>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>For the next few days Sera Ketill went about with a
preoccupied air. He was trying to weigh the situation
and settle his plans.</p>

<p class='c004'>If his father and Ormarr had thought he would give up the
struggle without protest, they were mistaken. He would not
allow himself to be crushed. If they asked for war, they
should have it. True, everything seemed to favour them at
present, but on the other hand, the odds absolved him, he
considered, from any obligation to be overscrupulous in his
choice of weapons. All’s fair in love and war.</p>

<p class='c004'>He remembered, with something like regret, the pleasant
spring evenings when he had wandered side by side with
Runa, enjoying a brief flirtation. Happy days—with nothing
but the pleasure of the moment to consider. He had no
longings to plague him, having all that he desired. He imagined
himself in love with the shy, dreamy child who trusted
herself so unreservedly to him. It had cost him something
to leave her, but, nevertheless, something within him told him
that he must; that he could not go on enjoying one idle,
happy phase, but must move forward to a new and more
strenuous one, that promised in return greater rewards for
greater strife.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, once he had left her, Runa had passed from his mind
entirely; all that was left of her was a vague memory, the
recollection of one of his minor adventures, a careless day
of sunshine in his past. He had never thought she would
cross his path again; it had never once occurred to him to
write to her. He regretted his thoughtlessness now. If he
had kept up a kind of correspondence with her, he might
have used his influence over the girl to some purpose. Anyhow,
it was fortunate that the incident had turned out as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>had. No scandal—not a soul to fear. He could be quite
easy on that score, for it was in the interest of the other party
that nothing should leak out. And, with a little deft manipulation
on his part, the hushing up of the matter might
even prove a most useful weapon in his hand. Again, all
was fair in love and war.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the whole, his position was not so bad. He had made
a good match, and his wife had considerable expectations in
addition to her present fortune. Yes, he would be able to look
after himself. Ormarr might take over the estate—for a time.
But he who laughs last, laughs best. When all was said and
done, his father and brother had not yet got him into their
power; he had his congregation, and his position gave him
an excellent opportunity to influence public opinion. Meantime,
he would take care to win them over by his powers of
persuasion generally, and gradually make them his faithful
adherents.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man had been furious on Sunday; he had probably
been far from appreciating his son’s talents as a preacher.
But he would know how to lash the old man’s feelings with
his words from the pulpit; he would reach farther and cut
deeper than any other had done before. No fanciful theology,
but argument backed by chapter and verse from the Scriptures.
There could be no question of defence or refutation;
it would be pleasant to see Ørlygur à Borg writhing under
the interpretations of the Old Testament delivered by his
son. Ay, he would show them that a priest was a man to
be feared, an enemy not to be lightly challenged.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill was already elated with thoughts of his victory
to come. He drew up far-reaching plans, and began at once
to con the doctrines of the Church in his mind—as weapons
to be used in his campaign against his father and brother.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Alma was left very much to herself; her husband had
little time to spare for entertaining her. When he was not
busy with his sermons, he was occupied out of doors.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cattle were brought in for water, and the sheep called
down from the mountain pastures where they had grazed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>throughout the summer. Their numbers had to be checked,
according to the list prepared when they had first gone out,
to see if any were missing. Then came the question as to
how many should be kept during the winter. The hay in the
lofts was measured out in horse-loads; one sheep needed but
a single horse-load for the whole winter, this being eked out
by the winter grazing grounds, which gave a certain amount
of feed each year, on the hillsides or down by the shore. A
cow, on the other hand, would need forty horse-loads, whereas
a horse could manage with ten. All these and other details
had to be considered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then came the killing season, and large droves of sheep
were sent off, either direct to the slaughter-houses or to the
market.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were repairs to be undertaken, buildings and outhouses
to be seen to; altogether, there were many things which
claimed Sera Ketill’s attention, and often his personal
supervision, especially the sale and slaughtering of the stock.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indoors, too, there was much to be done; supplies of dried,
preserved, and pickled provisions were invariably laid in for
each winter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma herself had not much to do. When it was fine enough
she went for long walks; otherwise, she spent most of her time
reading or sewing. Now and again she would go out into
the kitchen, and try to talk to the maids. When Kata was at
liberty, Alma sought her company, either in the kitchen or in
the sitting-room. Kata preferred the former; it seemed to
her a mark of favouritism to be invited into the inner rooms.
Alma had come to appreciate highly the old woman’s straightforward
earnestness and her power of maintaining discipline
when necessary, and old Kata had no greater wish than to do
all in her power for her young mistress. She carried out her
duties faithfully, and saw to it that the other servants did
the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma had thus plenty of time to consider her own position.
But it was a difficult matter to arrive at any clear conclusion
out of the maze of moods and fancies that filled her mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>At times she even thought of returning home to her people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>but only for a moment. She felt she would never be able to
take up the threads of her old life again. And indeed, from
a practical point of view, it seemed impossible. What would
her husband say to such a step? Moreover, she would probably
be having a child before long.</p>

<p class='c004'>Apart from these considerations, however, she could hardly
bring herself to leave the country; it had made a powerful
impression on her from the first, and she felt herself strangely
under its spell. Here, at least, she could live, even if she
had to renounce all idea of any happiness in her domestic
life with her husband. If she went away now, she felt that
a part of her being would be left behind; to live elsewhere
would be spiritless, intolerable.</p>

<p class='c004'>She bore with resignation the shattering of her dreams
of love, and made no attempt to deceive herself with ideas
of a future reconciliation. Love, she felt, would play no
further part in her life; when she endeavoured to sound
her feelings on this point, she found herself coldly indifferent.
Her conscience was in no way hurt by her attitude towards
her husband; it could not be otherwise, since he on his part
seemed to have no longer any pleasure in the possession of
her, regarding her merely as a chattel he had acquired.</p>

<p class='c004'>She even went so far as to imagine that he had never loved
her, but only pretended to do so, and had only won her by
sheer selfish calculation. In the days of their courtship, such
a thought had never entered her mind; but now, disappointment
had driven all love away, leaving only a sense of injury.</p>

<p class='c004'>Chiefly dominant, however, was the sense of indifference;
Alma had almost become a fatalist. Sorrows and disappointments
were things to be taken as they came, and stacked aside,
as a card-player lays aside the tricks he has taken, or a miser
packs away his treasures. All unknowingly, she was gradually
developing in herself something of the essential character
of the country that had so impressed her; so it was that the
snow gathered and hung on the mountain-side, ever more and
more, until it crashed down in an avalanche, burying houses
and men, or sweeping them out to sea. So also in the heart
of the volcanoes molten stuff was gathered slowly—to burst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>forth one day and spread death and desolation abroad. And
human beings might do as they, gathering slowly the force
that, suddenly loosed, should change their destinies.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Autumn spread its heavy tones over the land, persistent,
yet ever changing.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were grey, wet days, when all things were obliterated
under masses of rain. Then violent storms, when window-frames
and houses rattled and shook, and the dust was whirled
in huge yellow clouds. Haystacks were caught in the whirlwind,
tumbledown cottages demolished; even the strongest
men were at times obliged to move on all fours over the hills,
to avoid being swept over some precipice. Boats along the
shore were crushed like egg-shells; there were sad days for
the fisherfolk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes the elements seemed to be resting, leaving the
weather calm and mild; at other times there would be days
of shifting light and shade, of scurrying clouds and sudden
hailstorms that left white streaks along the hillsides where
they passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The days were growing shorter; everywhere the advance of
darkness made itself felt, like a mighty bass in the autumnal
choir, relieved by the clear treble of the stars and the northern
lights.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma spent the long evenings at home for the most part,
busy with her own thoughts. There was little interchange
of words between her and her husband. They seemed separated
by a gulf of silence; Ketill, apparently, found nothing
distressing in the fact. It was convenient to have a wife
who was quiet, and did not bother him. But Alma felt as if
they lived in different worlds, with but the slightest link between
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes the fact that they were married—and the
intimacies which alone declared it—seemed to her so tragically
humourous that she had to bite her lips lest she should
break out into bitter laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The autumn nights had a depressing effect on her mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>filling her with a consuming pain—a deep and intolerable
longing for some one in whose heart she had a place, though
but the merest little corner, where she could feel at rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>At milking-time, about ten o’clock, she could be sure of
finding old Kata in the cowshed. And often she would steal
out to her there, watching the old woman at work in the dim
light. Old Kata knew that her mistress might be coming, and
sent off Kobbi, the old cowman, for a jug, which was filled
straight from the udder,—an especial piece of consideration
on the part of Kata,—and the three would sit talking together
as best they could. The two old folk had already taught
their mistress something of the language, enough at any rate
for her to understand them, and now and again put in a
word herself.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Time rolled on.</p>

<p class='c004'>The autumn nights grew longer; the days dwindled
to a few hours’ feeble light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Winter was near at hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then came the snow. First one night, when all was still.
There it lay next morning, a soft, white sheet spread out
under a blue-tinted sky. All the earth seemed silent as in
church, at the hour of meditation. And when any sound
broke the stillness, its echo seemed to dwell in the ear for
longer than usual, dying away slowly, as if loth to depart.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wind came, levelling the snow to fill the hollows of the
ground; then more snow, then rain, and then frost; winter
was come in earnest, come to stay. Heavy, murky clouds
shed their burden of snow, but passed away again; winter
had many aspects and was never one thing for long at a
time. Westerly winds flung the snow hither and thither,
mountain torrents rushed down on their way to the sea. And
then suddenly, in the midst of all this wild confusion, would
come calm, clear nights, of ghostly quiet, no sound to be
heard save the murmur of the sea, like beating of the wings
of time.</p>

<p class='c004'>And men lived on, under the heavy yoke of winter. It
seemed as if the winter itself were ever trying to foist itself
upon them, claiming acknowledgment of its presence. It
set its mark upon the window-panes, thrust itself at them
through the cracks of doors; but they strove to keep it out,
thawing the pictures on their windows, bundling the snow
from their thresholds with scant ceremony, even with abuse.
No wonder that the winter turned spiteful at times, lying in
wait for men and leading them astray in storms, luring them
to destruction in some concealed ravine where their last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>breath could be offered up as a sacrifice upon its altar. It
was but reasonable so.</p>

<p class='c004'>This winter, the Hofsfjordur folk had little time to spare
for contemplation of the usual struggle; they took the necessary
steps for their protection, but their minds were largely
occupied with other matters.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was the new priest, Sera Ketill, son of the mighty
King of Borg—and he gave them food for thought in abundance.
From his first sermon, he had made his influence felt,
chiefly, perhaps, through his eloquence and the depth of feeling
he seemed to display. Then, later, it became evident that
there was a certain tendency in his discourses; his arguments
pointed towards some conclusion, though what this was could
hardly be seen as yet. His masterly treatment of his texts
revealed an iron will, that had evidently set itself some great
and difficult task.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill revealed himself as a fanatic, stern and merciless
in his interpretations and demands. He appeared as an
idealist, looking ever toward the goal of perfection, which he
seemed to regard as undoubtedly attainable. In his judgments
and castigation he was unrelenting as a Jesuit; his doctrine
was clear and hard, admitting of no compromise: if the eye
offended, pluck it out; if the offending hand were nearer and
dearer than all else, there was still no way but one—cut it
off and cast it from thee. Thus Sera Ketill taught his flock.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sunday after Sunday the church was full; week by week
Sera Ketill knit more closely the bond between his parishioners
and himself. At first they admired him, but it was not long
before they came to love him. What had been, was forgotten;
he was their priest now. All knew that Ormarr was to inherit
Borg after his father, and it was not difficult to forgive Ketill
for having, in earlier days, cherished other hopes. Plainly
he had himself been the first to mortify the flesh, and put
away his own worldly desires. And who should call him to
account for any youthful indiscretions? After all, perhaps
he had not been serious in his reputed intention of discontinuing
the benign and considerate rule that had been a tradition
of the Borg family towards those round them. His sternness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in matters spiritual, on the other hand, was unimpeachable;
it showed his earnest desire for the welfare of their souls, and
those who followed his precepts were happy in so doing,
even though it cost them something to break with the old
easy-going ways. Conscience needed to be kept awake and
sensitive. And it was not altogether unpleasant to come to
church and be rated and stormed at for all backslidings; one
sat listening with beating heart, subject to an emotion which
Sera Ketill’s predecessor had certainly never had power to
call forth. The wearisome homilies of the old days, full of
spiritless and superficial argument, had made it hard for
them to keep decorously awake. But now, it was a different
atmosphere altogether. “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thine heart.” Also, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.” But hence it followed that one should tolerate
nothing in one’s neighbour that would not be tolerated in
oneself. “For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,” ay,
jealous even towards His children. Wherefore it behoved
them to adopt a similar attitude towards those around them.
Wheresoever anything became apparent which was not in the
spirit of God, let them rise up and denounce it; if they suffered
any among them to look with scorn, or even with indifference,
upon the Holy Word, then they themselves were guilty. And
for such sinners there was nothing but everlasting damnation;
the Scriptures had declared it plainly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill’s doctrine admitted but two alternatives—either
heaven or hell.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he did not confine his teachings to the pulpit. His
eyes were everywhere, and as often as he discovered anything
among his flock that was not according to his teaching,
he was ready with word and deed. And he brooked no
resistance—he spoke in the name of the Lord. Illegitimate
relationships that had gone on for years were ordered to be
legalized; it was not an uncommon thing for an old couple
who had never been properly married to appear in church for
the ceremony with their grown-up children as witnesses. A
fever of zeal spread from the vicarage throughout the parish.
True, there were occasional murmurings from those who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>called upon to mend their ways, but even they felt the power
of this new influence in their hearts. And little by little the
flock was led into the paths of righteousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>First and foremost, Sera Ketill demanded of his congregation
that they should attend regularly for worship in God’s
House, where, by hearing of the Word, their hearts might
be opened to receive the Lord. Anything beyond a single
Sunday’s absence called forth a visit and a reproof for
neglect. Thus it was not long before Sera Ketill became the
unquestioned leader of the parish, acknowledged by all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the poorer folk he gained great popularity by foregoing
his right of grazing on their land; here was an example
near to hand of the self-denial he preached. Such a thing
had hardly been heard of before. Plainly, Sera Ketill was
one who himself lived up to his principles.</p>

<p class='c004'>His judgment was taken as infallible, any decision on his
part was to them as if inspired by the Almighty. And week
by week they grew more and more dependent upon him;
every Sunday he whittled away some portion of the spiritual
independence they had hitherto enjoyed. Yet they hardly
felt it as a loss; they were made to feel that it was pleasing to
God that they should do as they were bidden.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill’s doctrine bore the outward semblance of hallowed
certainty and divine infallibility. But there was something
vague about it still, something that had not yet been declared
outright. A sense of expectancy, half-unconscious,
perhaps, hung over the parish. Whither was Sera Ketill
leading them? What was it that was coming?</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill himself realized well enough that his scope of operations
was limited: he could only carry matters to a certain
point. Like a skilful general, he carefully estimated the
fighting strength at his disposal, and never permitted himself
to indulge in any over-sanguine imaginings as to how far his
people would follow him when it came to the pinch. Above
all things, he must not lose his head; must not act prematurely.
His objective was clear, but it could only be reached by
patience. Given but time enough, the ripened fruit would
fall at his feet. Meantime, he must foster the growing zeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>among his flock; in time, they would be ready for any outburst
of fanaticism. Not too quickly—no. But his time
would surely come.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg attended service regularly; Sunday after
Sunday he listened to the wild outpourings of his son. And
sorrow and wonder grew in his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill strove to maintain his appearance of sincerity towards
his father, but he knew that the old man saw through
the mask.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur, on his part, for all that he had declared that
Ketill could no longer deceive him, found it hard to account
for his son’s zeal. If he were not serious, then why&nbsp;...
what was he aiming at? But again and again he felt an
instinctive certainty that his son’s preaching was not inspired
by any divine influence.</p>

<p class='c004'>And apart from the religious aspect, Ørlygur was sorely
troubled to see the people thus easily led. He knew his
folk, and was himself a leader of no common power; he could
not but wonder now, whither they were being led. Also, he
knew only too well the cold reaction that often follows undue
excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many a long winter night the King of Borg tossed restlessly
in bed, uttering many a prayer to God—the only Being
whose superiority he acknowledged. He was weighed down
by a sense of impending disaster—there was trouble coming,
and coming swiftly nearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill was the leading source of his uneasiness; again and
again he asked himself if he could not somehow step in and
avert the threatening catastrophe. But he racked his brains
in vain to find any way in which he could act as things were.
What was there for him to oppose? He could not take action
against his son’s enthusiasm in the cause of religion and
piety? Heaven forbid! Was he to endeavour to minimize
the devotion of the people to their God? Even though
Ketill’s heart were cold, and his zeal but a sham, who could
say but that he might yet be an instrument in the hand of
the Lord—a creature inspired as to his deeds, though not in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>spirit? Ørlygur à Borg could not raise his hand against
Heaven.</p>

<p class='c004'>For all this, his suspicions never abated, but rather increased,
as he watched the growing hold of his son upon the
parish. Was it not a masked attack upon the supremacy of
Borg? His son was trying to usurp his place as chieftain.
He called to mind the story of David and Absalom, and
David’s bitter lament for the death of his son. And he
could not free himself from the thought that Heaven must be
working out some plan with Ketill, the prodigal; at times,
also, it seemed that something evil were lying in wait. And,
in such moments, the old man longed to take his son, his
child, in his arms, and weep over him, despite all the wrong
he had suffered at his hands. Ørlygur made no attempt to
disguise from himself the baseness of Ketill’s conduct, but
he fancied it might be the will of God moving in some mysterious
way. His heart was torn by the meanness and hypocrisy
of his son; he felt himself wounded to the death. And yet
all the time his heart was bursting with a desire to forgive.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, the same disgust and aversion filled him
every time they met. He felt he must step in and put a
stop to all this underhand scheming and working; Ketill was
a creeping, venomous thing, to be crushed underfoot ere it
had wrought irreparable harm.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the first time in his life Ørlygur felt uncertain of himself,
wavering as to his proper course of action. He doubted
his right to lead; doubted even if he had been right up to now
in stewardship under God of all that was His.</p>

<p class='c004'>He searched his conscience, yet he could find no evil there.
Yet what if his judgment of himself were at fault, blinded
by pride and self-deceit? How should a man judge of himself?—God
alone could judge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The brave old warrior was stricken and weakened now; his
own flesh and blood had wounded him, and, in face of it, doubt
and uncertainty gripped his soul.</p>

<p class='c004'>The winter wore on.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each day brought the foreboding of disaster more and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>prominently to Ørlygur’s mind; each night increased the
restless tension of his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then late in March came a letter from Ormarr, then in
Italy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The news was encouraging; Runa had borne a child, a
son, some weeks before, and both were well. Ormarr and
his wife were happy together; Runa appeared to have forgotten
her past trouble, and Ormarr did his best not to revive
any unpleasant memory. He himself was well and happy,
though longing at times for his home at Borg; he was anxious
to return, and tend and comfort his father in the last years
of his life.</p>

<p class='c004'>They would be coming back as early as could be managed,
reaching Iceland in June. The child was to be regarded as
newly born; it could hardly be difficult to conceal the exact
truth as to its age. And as Ørlygur knew, they had been
married in Denmark the previous autumn. Finally, Ormarr
bade his father be of good cheer, and wished to be sincerely
remembered to his sister-in-law, Alma.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur found the letter encouraging, yet at the same
time there was something in it that saddened him. He was
glad to have the support of his son’s youth and strength in
his loneliness, and his heart went out to the boy in welcome.
Here, at last, he would have some one he could trust, some one
in whom he could confide. But at the same time, there were
fears in his mind as to what would come when Ormarr
returned, and his anxiety increased as the time for his homecoming
grew nearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gloomy dreams haunted his sleep—a thing he had never
known before. What it all meant was beyond him, but somehow,
all seemed to centre round the idea of approaching death.
At the same time, he realized with dread that there might
be worse in store for him than death—something more terrible
than what was after all but a natural end.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The winter was a hard time for Fru Alma.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never, surely, had a tender, womanly heart
been so overwhelmed with loneliness and doubt,
conflicting feelings and bewildering thoughts, or borne it all

<p class='c004'>A snow-white lily snatched from the sunny spring and
thrust away into a gloomy loft. And what is the withering
of a lily to the agonies of a human heart? Here was a
human creature, plucked from a careless butterfly existence
under a cloudless sky of youth, and transplanted to a land of
grim solemnity and earnest—the home of Fate, where dreams
and omens and forebodings reigned; who could endure it
and not suffer?</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma’s soul developed in adversity, but it was an unnatural
growth—the growth of herbage in the shade, outwardly
luxuriant, no more. Such growths, once brought into
the light of the sun, must wither and shrink, to rise no
more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardest of all, perhaps, was the monotony of her life.
Despite the changing weather, lengthening days, intercourse
with people around her as she picked up a little more of the
language, despite the busy Sundays, it was a sadly uneventful
existence, and there seemed no hope of relief in the future.
The coming years loomed out as burdens to be borne in due
course, days of drab wakefulness, with restless nights of evil
dreams; the healing rest that night should bring was but a
mirage.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the loneliness became unbearable she would seek
the company of old Kata, or of the other servants. And her
kindness to them all was soon known far and wide. Were
any in trouble, be sure Fru Alma would not pass them by;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>her generous sympathy was recognized by all. “The Danish
Lady at Hof,” they called her, and looked to her as one
to whom any appeal for help should naturally be made, as to
a patron saint, or the Son of God Himself. And there was
no irreverence in the comparison.</p>

<p class='c004'>The vicarage was constantly besieged by beggars and
vagabonds; Sera Ketill, scenting personal advantage to himself
in his wife’s reputation for charity, encouraged her in
the work. He thanked her—but his thanks were insincere
and superficial, and Alma was not deceived. She and old
Kata were the only ones who saw through him, each in her
own way. The two women never spoke of him together; he
was the one theme upon which they never exchanged confidences.
Alma could not speak ill of her husband to any one,
and it was not old Kata’s way to make ill worse. Kata knew
exactly what went on at the vicarage, and she was the only
one who did. Ørlygur was only partially aware of the true
state of affairs between Ketill and his wife.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Kata, who herself had never been wife nor mistress to any
man, was more outspoken with Fru Alma than she had ever
been with any other soul. She found in her a creature pure
and undefiled as herself, a nature trustful and unsuspicious,
with that high confidence that gives the greatest worth, beyond
what ordinary sense can perceive. And Kata tested her in
many ways before venturing to speak freely; but Alma
passed every ordeal triumphantly, unaware that she was being
tried. Chief of all was absolute, voluntary silence, speaking
of a matter to none until one knew that speech was but as
speaking to oneself. Good wine should not be poured into
untried vessels.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is hard to say whether old Kata’s confidences were to
Alma’s good or the reverse. In any case, it was a relief to
her to talk with the old woman, and at first she paid but
little heed to what she heard. There were strange themes
which she would never have dreamed of discussing with any
one, and when alone, she gave them but little thought.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Gradually, however, they became more insistent, and laid
firm hold on her mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>True, she never saw nor heard “things,” as old Kata
claimed to do; she was not given to seeing visions, and certainly
had no claim to the power of second sight. But she
had strange dreams which Kata, when in the mood, would
interpret in such wise that Alma became thoroughly convinced
of the old woman’s powers.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had strange talks together at times.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why is it, do you think, Kata,” Alma might ask, “that
there is always more suffering than joy in life?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I doubt but it’s all because they crucified the Son of
God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But don’t you think there’s many a human being must
have suffered as much as He did? Others have been crucified,
you know; and then death on the cross is not the worst kind
of torture that could be imagined.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, there’s many a heavy cross to be borne, that’s true.
But God is God, and that’s another thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Or Fru Alma would start another theme, asking Kata’s
views as to whether sufferings of human beings were confined
to this world, or if there were perhaps still greater pains and
trouble to come.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Kata opined that each and every one would receive punishment
or reward according to their doings in this world.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It seems to me,” said Alma quietly, “that we are so
bound by inherited weakness and sin that however much evil
we may do, we cannot fairly be judged beyond our life on
earth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s a deal in that, maybe,” answered Kata. “And
there’s many a poor sinner not rightly answerable for all
they’ve done. But God is God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>One day, when a number of dead bodies from a wreck had
been washed ashore in the fjord, Alma said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sometimes I can’t help thinking that mankind, for all
the limitation of our powers, could manage some things more
justly at least than Providence seems to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never speak like that,” said old Kata warningly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Think of the Scriptures. ’Tis God’s finger guiding all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I know it’s a blessed thing to have faith in time of
trouble. And as long as it’s only oneself.... But when
something dreadful happens to others, and there seems no
sense nor reason for it all, then one can’t help asking, why,
what is it all for? Surely one might think that a heavenly
providence would be kind, and work for our good.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, ’tis strange to think, no doubt,” answered Kata.
“And there’s times when it’s hard to answer such things.
But God is God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This last expression was a constant formula in Kata’s
mouth, which to herself at least seemed to dispose of the most
difficult problem.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma ventured to put a direct question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you never felt yourself, sometime, that you didn’t
really want to say ‘God’s will be done’?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now you’re asking me something,” said Kata, “and
something I’d not answer to any but yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The spinning-wheel stopped, and Kata paused; not a word
was uttered for some moments. At last the old woman went
on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Once there was a poor man and a young woman. She
was not rich, neither, but they two were fond of each other,
and gave each other promise. They would wait till they
could buy a little farm; it might take years, but they would
wait. You know the hills over yonder they call the Dark
Mountains. Well, the young man, he went up there to serve
with a farmer who offered him good wages. And the girl,
she stayed behind, and never saw him all that summer. But
she had her ring to look at, and hope. In the autumn, he
came down over the mountains to see her. And there came
a snowstorm on the way, and he was frozen to death in the
mountains....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Kata’s voice had changed; its tone brought tears to
Alma’s eyes, and though the speaker herself shed never a
tear, it was a little time before she could go on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. ’Twas a hard blow to my faith at the time, and
I was all doubt in my heart. But later on that same year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>I learned the truth. He was going to marry the daughter
of the farmer he’d been working with, and only came down
to ask me to give back the ring and give me mine again. And
then I said ‘God’s will be done.’ ’Twas providence clear
enough. ’Tis not for us mortals to fathom the ways of God,
and there’s much that seems mysterious, ay, and hard and
unjust. But God is God. And we’re but weak things in
His hand, without understanding. But for all that we can
make our hearts a shining light, and show the way to wanderers
that’s lost the way.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>When Alma knew she was to give birth to a child, she
gave way entirely, and pent-up tears burst forth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, how could it, how could it ever come like this?” she
moaned.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was to bring forth a child that should carry the nature
of its father or its mother—to what degree she could not say.
And the prospect of a child she felt she could not love filled
her with horror, the curse of a joyless motherhood. If only
God in His mercy had made her barren; had spared her the
anguish of bringing another life into this world of suffering
and misery.</p>

<p class='c004'>She wept herself by degrees into a calmer state, and a sense
of pity and self-reproach grew up in her—pity for the new
little being to come, and self-reproach that she herself was
so weak.</p>

<p class='c004'>Surely it was sinful to look forward without thankfulness
to motherhood, a sin against the child unborn.</p>

<p class='c004'>And yet—how could she ever be glad?</p>

<p class='c004'>Life was a void to her; she had no desire in life but to
cease living. Listlessly she saw the days go by, the burden
of her sorrow ever increasing.</p>

<p class='c004'>But those around her paid little heed; they had seen so
many young mothers who seemed to think themselves laden
with all the trouble of all the world.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg noticed her condition, and saw, too, that
she took no pleasure in the prospect. His heart was touched
at the thought, and his tenderness towards her increased.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Often on Sundays he would arrive some time before the
service, in order to see her, and if he could, console her a little.</p>

<p class='c004'>They went to church together, the old man and the young
woman; Alma still sat in her old place beside his. And she
was grateful for his kindness and friendliness; he seemed
to her the most lovable man she had ever known.</p>

<p class='c004'>One Sunday, just before church, Ketill happened to return
to the house, and found his father’s overcoat hanging in the
hall. The lining was outward, and the corner of an envelope
showed in the pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill glanced round, listened, and seized the letter, slipped
into a room close by and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hurriedly he read the message through. It was Ormarr’s
letter telling of the birth of Runa’s child.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill’s hands trembled, and his face flushed. With a nervous
laugh he thrust the letter into his pocket. Then, as
by an afterthought, he took it out again, stood for a moment
irresolute, and making sure he was not observed, put it back
in the coat from which he had taken it.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went back to join his father and Alma, in the sitting-room,
trying hard to appear unmoved. But he felt he could
not quite control himself, and began fumbling among some
papers on the writing-table. He was still thus occupied
when the bell rang for the last time. His wife and Ørlygur
would have waited for him, but he bade them go on, saying
he would follow immediately.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill waited till their steps had died away, then hurried
out to the hall; he knew he was now alone in the house. He
took down the coat, and let it fall to the ground, where it
might seem to have slipped from the peg. Then he took the
letter from the envelope, and laid it unfolded by the coat, as
if it had fallen out.</p>

<p class='c004'>This done, he hurried across to the church. On the way
he stopped, felt in his pocket, and beckoning to a lad near,
whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I left my pocket-book on the writing-table in my room.
Run in and fetch it for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy ran off to obey, and passing through the hall noticed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the coat lying on the floor. He stopped to pick it up,
and caught sight of the letter. He glanced through it,
hardly knowing what he was doing, and finally left everything
as he had found it.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he reached the church with the pocket-book, he
was evidently ill at ease; those who remarked it put it down
to embarrassment at attracting attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill’s sermon was not so effective today as usual.
Possibly his delivery was in part responsible. The priest
seemed curiously absent; once or twice he even came to a
standstill, and had to cast about for words.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was the custom for none to leave the church till the priest
and his family had left. Sera Ketill seemed in a remarkable
hurry today. He strode across to the house at once, and
quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Coat and letter lay where he had left them, but had evidently
been moved. Ketill smiled. He picked up the letter,
slipped it into the envelope, and put it back in the pocket.
He had barely finished when Ørlygur and Alma entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had noticed nothing, but Alma thought it strange
to find her husband there in the hall, after he had made such
haste to leave the church, doing something with his father’s
coat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her heart beat fast, and she turned to Ørlygur.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another time, father, when you hang your overcoat up
like that, be sure there is nothing in the pockets.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As she spoke, hardly realizing what she had said, at first,
the consciousness of her own suspicions of her husband came
to her suddenly, and she flushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur laughed, and answered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think there is anything to be afraid of.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he felt in his pockets. “Nothing here but a letter
from Ormarr, and any one’s welcome to read that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He spoke lightly, but a moment afterwards, recollecting
the contents, he turned pale. Alma noticed it, but tried to
appear unconcerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Ørlygur had gone, she remained standing, deep
in thought.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>It dawned upon her that there must be some connection
between her husband’s evident nervousness and Ørlygur’s
sudden start. What it could be she was unable to imagine.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outwardly calm, she rejoined her husband.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father showed me a letter he had just received from
Ormarr.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did he <em>show</em> it to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill sprang up suddenly, and came towards her, but she
appeared not to notice, and went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr and his wife are getting on nicely. They are
in Naples, and expect to be home early in June.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you read the letter?” asked Ketill, with a careless
air.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Ørlygur told me what was in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma was watching her husband’s face, and could not fail
to mark the smile with which he greeted her last remark.
Evidently, he had got hold of the letter himself somehow, and
found in it something that Ørlygur would not willingly have
known.</p>

<p class='c004'>With bowed head, she left the room, and went to her bedroom,
threw herself on the bed, and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her husband was a thief—a priest, and a thief.</p>

<p class='c004'>What a cruel burden was this Heaven had laid upon her.
What would this man’s child be? Oh that the Lord would
take it before ever it woke to life!</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma wept long and bitterly, falling at last into a heavy
sleep. It lasted but a little while, however, and she awoke in
high fever.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was put to bed, and a doctor sent for. But before he
could reach her, the trouble was over—Alma had given her
child to the world—stillborn.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Alma came to herself, she saw her husband bending
over the little body, which they would not allow her to see.
Ketill’s face showed neither tears nor sorrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>And she thought to herself: I shall die now. And it will
be laid in the earth by my side, with never a kindly look
from any human being in this world.</p>

<p class='c004'>With an effort she managed to raise herself on her elbow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and glance down into the cradle where the little body lay.
It was all uncovered, on a white sheet, so very small and grey,
with little white finger-nails. The sight was like a hot
steel in her heart. And with a cry she fell back, unconscious.</p>

<p class='c004'>For several days Alma lay between life and death, and
when at last the crisis was passed, she looked up to find old
Kata by her side.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old woman smiled encouragingly, but would not let
her speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lie still, my dear; the worst is over now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A day or two later, when Alma was well enough to sit up
in bed a little, she asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“How long have I been lying here, Kata?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is the tenth day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I been ill so long? And who has been watching
besides you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, I’d have none but myself for that. I’ve slept a
little now and again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma grasped the old woman’s wrinkled hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How ever could you, Kata! And how can I ever thank
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need to try, my dear. ’Tis enough that you’re getting
well again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I—did I talk in my sleep at all?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, nothing to worry about. Said this and that, maybe,
but I paid no heed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Kata busied herself about the room, avoiding Alma’s eyes.
“’Tis no use listening to feverish talk,” she added.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the long days that followed, while Alma was in
bed, Kata told her fairy stories about kings and princes, with
some idea of diverting her thoughts. And Alma could not
but smile at the old woman’s curious ideas as to the life of
royalty; she did not, however, attempt to correct her impressions.</p>

<p class='c004'>But once, in a pause, Alma broke in suddenly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor little mite—lying out there in the cold.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>She had learned of the burial of her child some time before.</p>

<p class='c004'>And she fell to crying softly at the thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Kata came to the bedside and stroked her hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All’s in God’s hand,” she said. “And all for the best.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>When Alma rose from her bed after six weeks’ illness,
she was but a shadow of her former self. Her
face was pale, with a yellow tinge, and her figure
wasted to a degree painful to see. She was hardly more than
a skeleton. Her dark eyes seemed larger, and glowed with a
strange, hard light, such as is seen in the still-open eyes of
one frozen to death. Her brown hair no longer stood in a
luxuriant cluster round her head; much of it had fallen out,
leaving hardly enough to cover the scalp and make a pitiful
little knot at the back.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had seen but little of her husband during her illness.
Twice daily he had paid her a brief, formal visit; but only
a few words were exchanged between them, and neither found
any pleasure in seeing the other. He slept in a different part
of the house, and they avoided each other as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill could not help noticing that his wife shunned him,
but, occupied as he was with his own affairs, it affected him
hardly at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma went about the house quietly, as she had always done,
with a smile and a kindly word for all. But though none
seemed to notice any change in her manner, her greetings were
less heartily felt than before. Her heart was dead within
her, and something was straining, straining to an intolerable
tension, until it seemed impossible to last. Something must
happen soon.</p>

<p class='c004'>She often went out to the little mound where her child lay
buried, and would stand for hours looking down at it.
Strange, to have a part of oneself lying there under the
frozen earth and yet to go about oneself with the warm blood
pulsing in one’s veins. It seemed unreal, yet it was reality.
Life seemed to have changed altogether.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was no longer glad that the child had not lived. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>had been a time when she had hoped for that very thing, but
when her wish was realized, came pangs of conscience that
destroyed her relief at its fulfilment. She no longer thought of
what her life might have been had the child lived; she forgot
that she had ever feared its birth; she had no feeling now but
sorrow for its death, and remorse that she had wished for it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Often old Kata would come to the churchyard to fetch her,
gently reproaching her for staying there so long.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis no good to let all the sad thoughts stay in your mind.
There’s life to be lived; you must not go wandering off among
the dead so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Alma would answer with a listless smile. One day
she asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think, Kata, that there really is any life in the
world?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, indeed, there is. And if the Lord takes one joy from
us, surely He will give something else in its place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not complaining,” Alma replied. “I have never
complained. But I have seen heavy crosses laid on weak
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They that seem weak can often bear the heaviest burden.
’Tis a sorrowful world, but, after all, ’tis only a moment in
eternity. And maybe we’re only here to be tried in the fire,
with trouble and affliction, and the ones that suffer most are
those God loves the best. As if He was taking special pains
with them, so they could be sooner ready to come to
Him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>One day, as Alma and Kata were standing in the churchyard,
two ravens flew by. They flew over the church, and old
Kata eyed them anxiously, making the sign of the cross.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, in a trembling voice, she said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“They flew over the church. ’Tis a sign that some one’ll
be called away before long.” And murmuring so that Alma
could scarcely hear, she added: “If it be Thy will, O Lord,
I should be taken, then Thy will be done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But to herself she thought: “If it should be the young
mistress that’s called, then Heaven be praised. I am old and
hard, I can wear on for a few years more, but the burden’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>over-heavy on her; if the Lord would take her in His mercy....
God’s will be done.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>During the period of Alma’s illness, a certain amount of
unrest had made itself apparent in the parish.</p>

<p class='c004'>First of all, there were rumours abroad. No one could
say where they had started, or how; it was impossible to trace
anything more than the inevitable “So-and-so said so-and-so.”
But the rumours were of a startling character, and it was
highly desirable to find out whether they originated from a
reliable source or not.</p>

<p class='c004'>Briefly, the matter was this: it was whispered that Ormarr’s
wife had given birth to her child as far back as the beginning
of March.</p>

<p class='c004'>And people made their calculations. The marriage
had taken place at the beginning of September the previous
year. That made the birth a great deal earlier than it should
have been. And yet the child was reported to be strong and
well, by no means as if born before its time.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was mysterious. The good folk searched their memories;
they could recall nothing unseemly in Runa’s behaviour
as they had known her; far from it. The marriage had been
rather sudden, true, but they had found nothing very
extraordinary in that. The girl had been waiting for Ormarr,
no doubt; no one had ever heard any other man’s name
coupled with hers. It was looked on as a pretty example of
a maiden’s patient waiting for her chosen lover, and Runa had
risen in the general esteem thereby. But now—there were
those who began to consider whether they might not have
been over-hasty in their conclusions.</p>

<p class='c004'>It looked as if there were something more behind it. And
it was not pleasant to find that one had been deceived.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing had leaked out as to Sera Ketill’s little affair with
his foster-sister some months earlier, and no one now thought
for a moment of connecting him in any way with the business.</p>

<p class='c004'>But who could be the father?</p>

<p class='c004'>Folk racked their brains to find one. Some had their own
idea, but it would have required a bold spirit to give it utterance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The name of Ørlygur à Borg rose to the minds of many.
He was the only man with whom Runa had been on intimate
terms, and for whom she was known to have cherished any
affection. That it should have led to such a result none had
ever dreamt—who could have believed it?</p>

<p class='c004'>But there it was. Live and learn—the lesson in this case
being a warning against misplaced confidence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Ørlygur had played his part well, and had been trusted
farther than he should. No, there was no trusting any these
days.</p>

<p class='c004'>But why had he not married the girl himself?</p>

<p class='c004'>’Twas simple enough—it was too late, and it would not do
to sully the good repute of the family. He would never
have survived the reproach had his wife been prematurely
confined, and for him to marry a young wife at all—a mere
child—was hardly suited to his dignity. So he had taken
this way out of it. Sent the girl out of the country with his
son, giving them strict orders to remain away long enough
to guard against any doubt as to the child being theirs.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had sacrificed his son, that was all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Originally, it had been intended that Sera Ketill should
inherit the estate. Every one was aware of that. And then
one day comes Ormarr—on a visit only—and before you
had time to turn round, he had sold his business and got
married. It was sudden, to say the least.</p>

<p class='c004'>And folk went farther.</p>

<p class='c004'>As far as they knew, Sera Ketill’s marriage had come
rather as a surprise to his father. Ah, the old fox! He
had reckoned, no doubt, on getting his younger son to take
over the paternity together with the estate. Then, by the
wildest piece of luck, when Ketill upsets his plans by coming
home married already, Ormarr makes all right again by coming
back himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ay, the Devil was kind to his own!</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not long before the parish had put two and two
together, and realized that Sera Ketill must have been aware
of the whole thing from the first.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Here</em> was the thought that inspired his preaching! Plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to see now the aim of all this Christian zeal. ’Twas the
preparation for a struggle that he had known was bound to
come; they had been watching it all the winter, never dreaming
what lay behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now it was beginning to get exciting. What did Sera
Ketill intend to do? Would he break with his family openly?
If so, how would it be done?</p>

<p class='c004'>The church was filled as never before; the listeners carefully
analysed the discourse from the pulpit, seeking some
clue that fitted in with their ideas, some hint as to what was
coming. But they learned nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill, on his part, saw that his plan had succeeded.
He could mark the growth of the seed in the faces of his
flock from Sunday to Sunday. And deliberately he made
his allusions vaguer and more general; now that all would
make the proper application of whatever he said, there was
no need for himself to deliver any direct attack.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a drama, played Sunday after Sunday in the church
between father and son—and the onlookers were thrilled with
a sense of some terrible end approaching.</p>

<p class='c004'>Parochial disputes were nothing new, but up to now the
people of Borg had always stood united on one side or the
other, and their side had invariably won. But this was different;
this was civil war—a house divided against itself.
And it meant a battle the like of which had never been known
in the records of the place.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only drawback was that there seemed no possibility
of doubt as to how it must end—unless some new development
occurred meanwhile. Not only had Sera Ketill right on his
side, but the Almighty was with him. And, moreover, he
had taken the precaution to enlist the entire congregation
under his banner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Altogether, it would need something like a miracle to get
that old fox Ørlygur out of the trap. No use for him to
gnaw off a pinioned leg or brush—he was gripped round the
middle, and there was no escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>The thought of this great idol’s fall was a thing to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>one shudder; even though he were to fall by his own misdeeds,
one could hardly help pitying him.</p>

<p class='c004'>After all, Ørlygur à Borg had always been their friend.
None had ever been so ready to help, so open-handed, as
he.... But he had always been a proud sort, Ørlygur à Borg,
and pride goeth before a fall.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was rather a conflict between a mortal and the Higher
Powers—and they were not so presumptuous as to think of
taking any part themselves. He would have to manage by
himself—even if it meant ruin and disgrace in the end.
However they might feel towards Ørlygur, the general
benefactor, they were not disposed to take up arms against the
Lord Himself for his sake.</p>

<p class='c004'>And what said Sera Ketill so insistently: “If thy hand
offend thee, cut it off....” Ay, even if that hand were
a brother, a near kinsman....</p>

<p class='c004'>Ay, Sera Ketill knew how to choose his words.</p>

<p class='c004'>And if he did not venture now to take his father’s part,
but stood up and opposed him at whatever cost, it was surely
because he realized that God’s commandments must come
before all else.</p>

<p class='c004'>The spirit of hypocrisy made its triumphal progress
through the parish.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was characteristic of the fanatical intolerance which
reigned that Ørlygur’s innumerable good deeds were forgotten
in the storm of righteous indignation that rose against him.
Folk great and small set themselves up in judgment upon
their old chieftain and found it easy to discover some selfish
motive behind every kindly and generous act of his in the past.
Those who owed him most were sternest in their condemnation,
and, in default of actual proof, were not afraid of
altering facts to support their case. And they quieted conscience
by the thought that even if all were not exactly as
they put it, there was still evidence enough against Ørlygur
to satisfy any reasonable mind. A little touch of colour one
way or another made no difference.</p>

<p class='c004'>The people had chosen; Ørlygur was already worsted and
down. Certain of the result, they had declared for the winning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>side—a fine example of the unstable character of humanity,
a weathercock moved by every puff of wind.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ketill was only waiting for the return of his brother and
sister-in-law.</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt a slight nervousness in the anticipation, though he
felt confident in his own mind as to the result of the blow
he was prepared to deliver. His plan was complete in all
details, all preliminary steps had been taken: he had but to
wait for the decisive moment to strike.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the waiting was monotonous. He had nothing more
to do, and his mind in idleness was plagued by distressing
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>If only he had some one to share things with, a companion
after his own heart. He was realizing now what it was to be
lonely. He even sought the company of his wife, but soon
observed that she shunned him as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gulf of silence between them had become almost impassable,
and he read enmity and suspicion in her glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had never meant to be unkind to her. Maybe he had
been a little neglectful at times—but she ought surely to have
realized herself how busy he was, and how hard it was for him
to find any time for little attentions.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had time enough now, and would have been glad to
make up for the past, if only by way of finding some comfort
himself in his loneliness. His mind was suffering under
a growing burden of isolation.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the daytime he could generally find something to do,
but the evenings were long, and the nights often unbearable.
He could not sleep, and his nerves soon began to feel the effect
of insufficient rest; he had to struggle, too, against
haunting thoughts that left him almost physically exhausted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes he even considered whether it might not be
better to give up the whole scheme. But after all the pains
he had taken to prepare it—no, he could not give up now.
If he stayed his hand, all would be lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>His wife seemed lost to him. She was coldly reserved, and
utterly unresponsive towards his advances. And his conscience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>troubled him. He could almost see himself, at times,
with her eyes; hear how his own words rang false in her ears.
He was a cheat—and what was worse, he had been found out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even if he gave up his plans now, it would not help him.
He could never win her back again, of that he was sure.</p>

<p class='c004'>With his father, too, it was equally hopeless. Ørlygur
would never trust him again, whatever he might do; and it
was not to Ketill’s taste to humble himself to no avail.</p>

<p class='c004'>No! If he gave up now, he would be utterly alone thenceforward.
The people would desert him, for his preaching
would no longer have any definite aim; his doctrine would
lack its dominant purpose. He would be alone, forsaken by
all, without a friend among his flock, his kin, or even in himself;
alienated even from his God. A creature to be despised,
or pitied; a thing of no account, unworthy either of hatred
or affection. Intolerable!</p>

<p class='c004'>No; if he were to be alone, he would at least have power.
If he could not win the trust and affection of his people, he
would at least command their obedience and outward respect.
No one should have the right to accuse him of
weakness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such were his conflicting thoughts as the days went on.
Ketill was thoroughly wearied of inaction; he longed for
the moment when he could act, as a child longs for its
birthday. Again and again he pictured to himself the events
of that day, conjuring up visions of his triumph; his one
desire now was for it to come, and make an end of the
waiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also, he began to feel less sure of himself; to fear lest
at the critical moment his nerve might fail him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once he had declared himself, however, there could be
no question of withdrawal; all doubt and wavering would
disappear; there he would stand, erect and strong, the
victor in a struggle that he had vowed to win or die.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was not blind to the danger of any weakness on his
own part; irresolution would be fatal. But once he could
take the decisive step, leaving himself no possibility of
retreat, all would be well.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Victory was certain—for he was fighting without mercy,
as injustice ever does.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Alma went about in the same dull, listless state as before.
She seemed to be living in a world apart from all that
went on around her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She noticed her husband’s restlessness, and that he seemed
to be trying to approach her. But she put it down to his
weakness and lack of society—a need for companionship of
any sort. And as a result, her antipathy increased. She
was good enough—in default of all else! But at other times
he cared nothing for her. It was not for her sake, not for
herself, he sought her. Ketill never realized how his neglect
had isolated her in a prison of solitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was impossible to speak to him about the state of
things between them; he would only gloss it over with an
utter disregard of the truth. And any open insincerity
and falsehood on his part would bring matters to a climax;
she would be unable to restrain her feelings. What would
happen exactly, she did not know; she did not venture to
consider the possibility. It seemed impossible that she could
ever survive such a revelation.</p>

<p class='c004'>And yet she had a painful intuition that it would come,
and that she would survive it. It was horrible to think
that she must go on living after that. Were she but certain
that it would kill her, she would gladly do her best to bring
matters to a head instead of avoiding and dreading it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But for the present the wheels of time seemed to have
stopped; life was at a standstill.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even the solitude she sought in her wanderings about
the country seemed dreadful to her now. Ice and snow,
ice and snow—the outlook was so bleak and desolate that
it brought her mind to the verge of insanity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her head ached intensely as she looked out over the
snow-covered waste; her brain seemed on the point of
bursting, she felt herself fighting to retain her mental
balance. Once she gave way there would be no recovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>She would find a dark corner somewhere, and sit down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>with her head in her hands, rocking to and fro. Snow
and barren waste—the sight of it worked on her till she
dared not face it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then came the sunshine of spring, and she could go
out once more. The snow was still there, but there were
breaks in its monotonous expanse. And day by day she
watched it disappear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then at last one day she heard the roar of the stream
as it broke through the ice of its winter bondage. She
hurried out to look.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ice had been carried out into the fjord, and lay there,
blue and green, rocking gently on the water. Later in the
day it lost its freshness, dulled by the sand and mud
carried down by the torrent. Streams were pouring everywhere
from the heights above, forming small pools here and
there where the water spread.</p>

<p class='c004'>And gradually the earth rose up out of its covering of
snow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The landscape was dark and bare, relieved here and
there by white specks—the ptarmigan had not yet changed
their winter plumage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the green of spring began to put forth, and birds
of passage arrived. The air grew milder, and the song of
birds was heard; there was a scent of growth abroad, a
promise of harvests to come.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early blossoms peeped out, braving the frosts with cheerful
smiles. Time went on, and the light nights came,
when the evening brought but a veil over the day, that
was drawn aside again at dawn, when the bright sun rose,
passing from a ruddy glow to a fullness of dazzling rays.
Butterflies lived their little lives, and sank to earth, to
pass through the cycle of nature before they came again.
The lambs of last year were mothers now themselves, wise
in the vicissitudes of life and saddened by experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the horses, even the older ones, forgot for a moment
their mere material needs, and galloped madly about under
the influence of the joy-filled air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cattle let loose for the first time from their confinement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>behaved in most undignified fashion; even the astonished
calves followed suit and joined in the romp with their
elders. Good-natured mothers pretended to let themselves
be outdone by their month-old offspring, until some youngster
grew overbold, and had to be reminded by what was
fitting. Great days, these, for a young calf, a time to play
at being a grown-up bull, and making ferocious charges
against all and sundry.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the light-heartedness of spring about her brought
at times a smile to Alma’s saddened face. But it was a
smile of pity rather than of pleasure. All these young
creatures, this life new to the world, had not yet tasted
the bitterness of existence upon earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>So she lived through the spring with the winter of life
in her heart, that nothing could melt away once it had set
in. No springtide for her, no budding and bloom.</p>

<p class='c004'>She longed only for peace—in forgetfulness or death.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Ørlygur a Borg was heavy at heart this spring.</p>

<p class='c004'>He marked the covert whispering abroad, and
it chilled him. But no one was anxious to be the
first to tell him of the rumours that had spread, and he
remained in ignorance of their essential theme. Yet he
could not fail to see that there was something in the air—something
that concerned himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The expression of men’s faces had changed. Ørlygur
found himself regarded with curious glances—sometimes
a look of wondering speculation, at times a look of something
like scorn. If he came unexpectedly upon a group,
they would cease their talking suddenly, or talk with such
eagerness of indifferent matters that it was clear they had
changed the subject on his arrival. They had been speaking
of him—or at any rate of something he was not to know of.</p>

<p class='c004'>At first he paid little heed to it all. What did he care
for their gossip? He had always held himself apart and
above all idle talk. Realities, matters of actual moment,
were the only things that interested him. Let them wag
their tongues if they pleased; say what they would of one
another, good or ill. It was always the same in the end—they
answered to the hand with the surest touch, not to
the mere possessor of a gift of speech.</p>

<p class='c004'>As days went on, their glances became more and more
ill-disposed and evident; the crowd seemed to increase in
boldness as its numbers grew. Ørlygur felt himself gradually
surrounded; even at Borg itself there was an air of restraint
apparent. His own people no longer met his gaze frankly,
no longer laughed heartily at his jests; his orders even were
no longer received and obeyed with the same willing alacrity
as before. If any task called for special effort, there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>longer the same eager haste to help. It seemed rather as if
he were being left to struggle by himself, an object of curiosity
as to how he would manage alone. He could see, too,
that he was being watched, as if all around him were trying
to read his thoughts, and with no friendly eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>Day by day it grew harder to bear. Ørlygur tried to
get at what was in their minds, insinuating opportunities
for them to speak out, but without avail. They could not—or
would not—perceive his invitations to tell him frankly
what was amiss.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sought out his best friends in the parish, those whom
he had befriended most. He called, not as with any evident
object, but casually, leaving it to them to speak of what
they evidently knew. But all to no purpose. It had not
been the way of those whom Ørlygur had helped to cringe
and fawn before him; they had acknowledged his assistance
as between man and man. But now they met him with
fluent insincerity, plainly trying to conceal the true state of
the case. Outwardly, they were humble and full of deference
and gratitude; but he could see their hearts were ice
towards him.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was hardly a soul in the parish who was not indebted
to him in some way. But now that he stood in need
of a friendly hand, their selfishness was revealed. Not one
had the courage to speak out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then came the third of May—the date when farm hands
and servants enter or leave their service.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was out and about betimes, looking to some lambs
that had just arrived. It was dinner-time before he came
back to the house. As he came up, he noticed that there
were no men to be seen outside, though some of the ewes
were in birth-throes and needing help. He attended to
the most pressing cases himself, and then hurried up to
the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here a further surprise awaited him. All the hands,
and the girls belonging to the house, stood with their boxes
ready packed.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the door he met the headman, dressed in his Sunday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>best and carrying a box. The man flushed a deep red at
sight of his master, but tried to appear unconcerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had come up with the intention of sending out
the first man he found to attend to the sheep. Now, he
gave no orders, but asked instead:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you leaving, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ye—es,” stammered the man, evidently ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you are not satisfied, why have you not told me
before, instead of going off like this without a word in
advance?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You never asked me to stay,” was the sullen reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have stayed on of your own accord now for twenty-two
years, since I took you in as a child.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This was undeniable. The man murmured something
about having found another place.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With Jonas à Myri.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. You can tell him from me that if he should be
in need of hay again, as he was last winter, he can come
to me as he did then. And now—you may go to the devil!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur turned on his heel and went indoors. In the
passage he met one of the girls, dressed in her best.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you going too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You did not ask me to stay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A plot, thought the old man, and turned from her without
a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the farm hands were dressed and ready to leave,
gathered together in a group. A silence fell on them as
he approached.</p>

<p class='c004'>One by one he asked them: “Are you leaving?” And
always the same answer: “You did not ask me to stay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur found difficulty in restraining his feelings. He
was deeply attached to his people, most of whom had been
in his service for many years. They had always got on
well together; the hands at Borg had better wages than
they could have obtained elsewhere. Some of them he had
engaged when no one else would take them, and they would
have been without support had it not been for his help.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>And now they were deserting him. Not one of them had
been man enough to declare his intention beforehand, and
give time for finding help elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur spoke with studied harshness, fearing to betray
what he really felt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get you gone, then, every man of you, and the sooner
the better.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It struck him that he had not seen old Ossa, who had
served him for fifty years, and had been like a second
mother to his children. He found her in the kitchen, preparing
his meal.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you not leaving too?” he asked bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m too old to go about the country seeking work,”
said she. Her voice seemed richer and softer than usual
as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it is only that, I could have lent you a horse,”
returned Ørlygur, with a note of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, I’ve no wish to be leaving Borg. ’Twill not be
of my own choosing if I should. And maybe I can be
some use a bit yet. As long as I’ve but my keep and
needn’t be a burden.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a slight pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ossa, what is it? Why are they leaving the place?”
Ørlygur asked, with some constraint.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Master’s the best judge of that, I take it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—they say it’s because I haven’t asked them to
stay on from last hiring. You know I’ve never asked
them; as long as I thought they were satisfied, I took it
they would stay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t they say about leaving before, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know that as well as I do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, Master can surely stop them; they’ve no
right to go if you order them to stay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m too old to beg favours. And I’ve no mind to call
in the law. You won’t tell me, then, what it’s all about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you don’t know, ’twould not help you to be told.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well, I’ll not try to make you speak against
your will. But I thank you for staying on.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“I’ll have your dinner ready directly. You’ll need it
this day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never mind the dinner. Put on a shawl and come and
give me a hand with the sheep. They are lambing all over
the place, and none to help them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Ørlygur strode out.</p>

<p class='c004'>A lamb was bleating pitifully at the back of the house.
He hurried over to the spot, and found the headman already
there. The man looked up as he approached. Ørlygur
strode forward, his face white.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are no longer in my service,” he said. “And I
do not want your help.” And with a blow he struck the
fellow to the ground, and went on, paying no further heed
to him.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg was left with none to help him save old
Ossa.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sheep alone were more than he could manage; hundreds
of them, and in the height of the lambing season.
Scores of the young lambs perished daily, for lack of care.
Ørlygur and Ossa worked all day and far into the night,
doing all they could, but despite their efforts, many of the
ewes died in giving birth, or strayed and were drowned or
bogged; many of the lambs starved within reach of the
udders they could not find. And it was impossible to milk
the burdened beasts; many were soon suffering from lack
of relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were the cows to be seen to as well; Ørlygur and
Ossa were so exhausted when at last they ceased work for the
night that neither could do more than sink down in a chair
for a few hours’ rest. They spoke only briefly, of necessary
things, and ate their food on the way to and from
their work.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the following Sunday, Ørlygur asked of those he met
at church if they knew of any hands to be had.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed that there were none available anywhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now he felt that they were rejoicing inwardly at
his misfortunes. All were against him, he felt certain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>but their opposition was so veiled that there was nothing
he could take hold of or challenge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Patience was the only thing. Ørlygur waited.</p>

<p class='c004'>It could not be long, he felt, before something leaked
out as to what lay at the root of it all. Some accidental
hint, a word let drop, might give him a chance to take the
matter up. And if he could but find out who was the
leader responsible for it all, it should go hard with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He suspected Ketill, but could not understand how he
could have such power in the parish already as to bring
about such a change in the general attitude of the people.</p>

<p class='c004'>As to his own practical difficulties—he might perhaps
get hands from farther off, but he could not be away from
the place himself, and there was no one he could send.
Nothing for it, then, but to wait patiently for Ormarr’s
return.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur shook his head sadly as he realized his helplessness.
Truly, he was getting old.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>The vessel was nearly due now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur kept a close watch on the fjord, and held three
horses in readiness for the moment when the ship rounded
the point.</p>

<p class='c004'>If only it would come! He shook his head; he had a
feeling that there was but a little time left him now to live.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he dreaded lest perhaps the ship should not come,
or something have prevented Ormarr from making the
voyage. He spoke to old Ossa about the weather; no,
surely it could not send a fine vessel to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur’s hands trembled incessantly; he was visibly
aged, and his voice quavered when he spoke of his own
affairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Ossa was deeply concerned, but strove to hide her
sympathy; Ørlygur was not pleased to find himself looked
on as a helpless creature, and was apt to turn on her
impatiently when he suspected her of overmuch anxiety
on his behalf. He would not be looked after like a child.
If she ventured to dry his socks at the fire, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>hanging them to air in the ordinary way, he would keep
his wet ones on. And when she tried to substitute new
mittens for his old and tattered ones, he gave up wearing
mittens at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Getting old I may be,” he grumbled, “but I’m not
an old woman yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then at last one day the ship hove in sight round the
point.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur hurried about, active as a boy, saddled his
horses, forgot all his troubles, and astonished old Ossa by
humming, all unconsciously, a fragment of a song, that he
kept repeating over and over again.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as soon as he was ready, off he rode to fetch his
son home.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill had likewise been awaiting the arrival of the
vessel with impatience, and had horses ready.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as he saw it had arrived, he hurried to his wife.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr and his wife have arrived—the ship is just
coming in. Get ready as quickly as you can. We must
go down to the quay and bid them welcome.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma looked at him in surprise; something in his manner
filled her with vague anxiety.</p>

<p class='c004'>She put on her riding things—her habit was sadly too
big for her now, but, after all, what did it matter? And
Ketill and his wife set off for the trading station, reaching
there just after Ørlygur himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and Runa had already come ashore, and the
party were about to set off for Borg when Ketill and Alma
arrived on the scene. All three tried to conceal their
astonishment: they had not expected Ketill.</p>

<p class='c004'>He greeted them with outward calm, and they tried, for
Alma’s sake, to appear as if there were nothing but good-will
between them. But all three found it difficult to meet
his glance. And Ketill smiled, as if with pleasure at the
meeting, but in reality with malicious satisfaction at the
evident impression his presence made. It was a tribute to
his power. It would not be easy to get rid of him now.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Ørlygur was trembling, and had the greatest difficulty
in controlling himself. Trouble was imminent now; of that
he was certain. And he puzzled his brain to find the reason
of Ketill’s appearance there—what had he to gain by it?</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr took the child, and helped his wife into the saddle.
He was very pale, and glanced covertly at Runa.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma came up to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is long since we met,” she said. And, noticing his
pallor, she asked anxiously if he were “unwell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is nothing—I felt a little strange for the moment,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr, on his part, noted how changed Alma was, how
ill and distressed. He was about to question her, but
checked himself; best not, perhaps, to ask anything at all
just now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma read his intention, and understood that he wished
to spare her. She felt she must hide the real cause, and
gave only the more direct reason for her evident ill-health.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I too have had a child since we last met,” she said;
and added after a pause, “and lost it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tears rose to her eyes. And just at that moment Ketill
came up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What—crying?” he said, putting his arm round her.
Alma shivered at his touch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill lifted the coverings from the child’s face and looked
at it. “So this is the little heir,” he said jestingly. “We
must have a look.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma also glanced at the child.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Congratulations, Runa,” said Alma, grasping her sister-in-law’s
hand. “And Ormarr”—turning to him—“and
you too, dear father-in-law. ’Tis a bonny child they have
brought you home. May it bring luck to the house!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, we need something to bring luck to the house,” said
Ørlygur bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma looked at him, surprised at his tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh—you mean you still can’t get hands for the farm
work?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur saw that she asked in all innocence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“No, my dear,” he answered. “And I am getting old.
When the little lad here has grown a bit, I may do as a
playmate for him, but little more. But we ought to be
getting home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All five rode off together. Not a word was spoken until
they reached the cross-road where Ketill and his Wife
turned off to take the short path to Hof.</p>

<p class='c004'>The three continued on their way in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was glad that the meeting had been got over;
sooner or later Runa would have had to meet Ketill, and it
was well that it was done. He rode up beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You managed splendidly,” he said. “I have never seen
a woman so brave and strong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa made no answer, but Ørlygur read her silence as
expressing thanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some way farther on she rode up to him again; he understood
that she had something particular to say. She rode
at his side for a little distance without speaking, then,
leaning towards him, she said in a low voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The past is forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And they rode on in silence. But, despite her words,
Ørlygur was not quite at his ease.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later, when they arrived at Borg, and he saw how Ormarr
helped his wife tenderly from her horse, and kissed her,
the tears rose to his eyes, and he thanked God that these
two, united in misfortune, seemed now, at least, to be living
happily together in love.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Ossa came out to meet them, and Ørlygur turned
to his son.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The only one that is left,” he said, pointing to Ossa.
“There are no more servants at Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?” queried Ormarr.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It means that I have become such a hard master in my
old age that I can neither keep old servants in my house
nor get new to come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Later on he told Ormarr how the servants and farm
hands had left with one accord, and how those he had befriended
among his neighbours round had turned from him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>in his need. He said nothing, however, of his suspicions
with regard to Ketill.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr thought for a moment, then turned to his father
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There must be something behind all this,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur nodded; he too was clear as to that, but what
was at the bottom of it all, he could not say.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr seemed anxious to pass over the matter lightly
for the present. “We must be able to get hands from
somewhere,” he said easily. “And if our neighbours can
do without us, I dare say we can manage without them.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill and his wife rode on for some distance without
speaking. Alma had an idea that Ketill wished to confide
in her about something, but was at a loss how to begin.</p>

<p class='c004'>She remembered how she had ridden that way with her
husband once before: she had wept then, because he left
her to ride alone. Now, the mere idea that he wished to
speak to her made her shudder.</p>

<p class='c004'>They came to the ford, and Ketill drew up close beside
his wife, lest she should fall dizzy in crossing. He told
her to close her eyes and hold on firmly, which she did.
They crossed without difficulty. Alma could hear that the
water no longer plashed about the horses’ feet. But she
still kept her eyes closed.</p>

<p class='c004'>She could feel that her husband was still at her side.
At length he spoke. His voice was unsteady, as if he
found it hard to speak at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to speak to you about something,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma opened her eyes and glanced at him timidly.
But Ketill was looking fixedly at his horse’s mane as he went
on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is an unpleasant matter, and I’m afraid it will distress
you somewhat. But it must be faced. And when the time
comes I am sure you will agree I have done rightly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paused for a moment, and then went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You saw the child?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>He waited, as if for an answer, but Alma made no reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did it not strike you as being extremely well-developed
for a child newly born? It is supposed to have been born
on the way up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean that the child is not theirs?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The child is Runa’s. But Ormarr is not the father,”
Ketill replied. “It was born in March. And Ormarr was
not in Iceland the previous spring.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma felt suddenly dizzy; she felt as if she must burst
into tears, but sat still, outwardly calm. Something told her
that though there might be something of truth in this, there
was yet falsehood and mischief behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bitter words rose to her lips; it was as if her husband
were making her an accomplice in a deed worthy of Judas.
But she dared not give vent to her feelings, and only said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, and if so, it is no concern of ours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It concerns us—as being of the family—and it concerns
me, as a priest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you propose to do, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have not heard all as yet. You do not know what
people are saying throughout the parish—that the father
of the child is—Ørlygur himself!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a lie!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma was quivering with rage; she had never been so
near to losing her self-control.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not say it is true. Until it is proved, we must
hope for the best. But you will no doubt agree with me
that the matter calls for the strictest investigation. Ormarr
and his father have treated the affair with great secrecy—that
looks bad, to begin with. Did you not notice
last year how Runa was kept out of the way when
we were there? And can’t you see now why it was?
Has it never struck you that her marriage was arranged
with extraordinary haste? The whole thing was settled
and done in a couple of days. It is a very awkward
business indeed for father; the entire parish is against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>him. All his workpeople left the place this spring, and
he has been there all alone, with but one old woman, until
now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did they leave him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably because they knew what was said about
him, and believed it true. Very likely they knew of some
little incident that proved it. And after that, of course,
they would not wish to have anything more to do with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma was at a loss what to reply. She had a keen desire
to defend Ørlygur, for she fully believed he was innocent.
But her brain was in a whirl, and the one thing uppermost
at the moment was an intense hatred of her husband.
But she would not give it rein. She was helpless, and
suffering bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think yourself?” she asked at last, in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not allow myself to <em>think</em>. But I have determined
to have the matter cleared up. That is all.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Sunday came. A glorious spring day with a bright
blue cloudless sky and the air a-quiver with heat;
a day of smiles without a shadow, breathing peace to
all mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Coming out into the sunshine on such a day, free from
the cares and toil of everyday life, the heart seemed filled
with a natural desire to give thanks and praise to God for
the blessing of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>But on this Sunday, there were few in all Hofsfjordur
whose minds were bent on praising the Lord. Folk hastened
to the service, but their thoughts were not with God. This
day, the first Sunday after Ormarr Ørlygsson’s homecoming,
was a day of mark; something, all knew, was about to
happen. And all repaired to the church to see. Even
tiny children were brought thither; no one was willing to
stay at home minding children today.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill was up and about before any of his people at
Hof. He moved about restlessly outside the house, avoiding
the grass, which was still thickly drenched with dew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again and again he glanced over in the direction of Borg.
A thin bluish column of smoke could be seen rising straight
up above the chimneys of his old home. And involuntarily
he found in it something like a symbol of peace. There was
something of a covenant in the ray of smoke that rose as it
were from some sacrifice acceptable to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c004'>How was this day to end? Sera Ketill asked himself
the question, and wondered who would be coming to church
from Borg that day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur and Ormarr moved about in silence, each bent
upon his own tasks. There was much to be done; they
had made no attempt as yet to secure new hands. It had
been agreed that Ørlygur should go to church, the others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>remaining at home. Had it not been for his duties there,
Ørlygur himself would rather have stayed away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early that morning he had fetched in Sleipnir, his
saddle-horse, from the fields, and stabled it without fodder
to be ready for the road. He let another animal into the
box to keep it company, and the pair remained there during
the morning, relieving the tedium of their confinement by
licking each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last it was time to start. Ørlygur had saddled his
horse, but delayed moving off, finding this thing and that
to attend to, as if loth to leave the place. Now and
again he stopped still, looking out over the country round;
from all quarters he could see his fellow-parishioners
come riding; all moving towards Hof as the centre of
attraction. He noticed, too, that the enclosure round the
vicarage was already dark with the crowd of those who
had come early.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally, realizing that he had no time to spare if he wished
to arrive in time, he stepped off resolutely. Then he turned
and stopped.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was in the courtyard, teaching a new-born lamb
to suck. He had been an adept at the work in his younger
days, but had forgotten his deftness now, and was fumbling
awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur went straight up to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think you had better come with me, after all,” he said.
“I feel—I feel lonely today, Ormarr. Never mind the
lamb, it will manage till we come back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr looked up. There was something strange about
his father’s manner today, something he had not noticed
before. He rose up without a word, saddled a horse, and
a few minutes later father and son set out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where the road was good, they gave their horses rein.
But Ormarr noticed that, despite the pace, his father was
constantly turning to look back at Borg. A new fancy
of his, he thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a stretch of difficult going just ahead; on reaching
it, they slackened speed, and rode on side by side at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a walk. Suddenly, and without preamble, Ørlygur said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had a strange dream last night. Curiously distinct
it was too. I was standing on the hill outside”—he
nodded towards Borg—“and a funeral came along the road—this
very way—towards the house. A great procession,
the biggest I had even seen. And the strange thing about
it was that it was coming from the church towards Borg—instead
of the opposite way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paused for a moment, and continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that was not all. I was quite sure that it was
my own corpse the people were following. And yet I stood
there on the hill myself, looking on. If it means anything at
all, I suppose it should be taken by contraries—to say that
I am to be buried alone, without a soul to follow me to the
grave.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They reached the level road as he ceased speaking, and
Ørlygur at once galloped on ahead; Ormarr did not overtake
him till they had reached the vicarage. Neither spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a numerous attendance of people. But it was
noticeable that they did not talk together, but busied themselves
tidying up after the ride with nervous care. There
was none of the customary laughter and easy conversation,
all seemed curiously silent. Neighbours did not move to
greet one another and shake hands; and none entered the
church. All waited, a silent crowd, with their minds at the
highest pitch of sinister anticipation.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the second time the church bell called to the worshippers
to enter. But no one moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>At sight of Ørlygur and his son riding up, the crowd remained
impassive, merely staring at the new arrivals as
they approached. But they watched them closely, with
occasional side-glances at others, who appeared to be watching
likewise.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Ørlygur rode up, he divined at once that no one had
as yet entered the church; that all were waiting for himself
and his son. They were watching them, too. One glance
showed him the situation, and his anger rose suddenly.
Usually, he dismounted outside the fence. But now, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>galloped straight across the enclosure, up to the wall of the
churchyard, Ormarr following at his heels. The crowd had
to give way hastily to avoid being trampled down. Still
there was no murmur, only the same watching glances from
all. And all could see that the master of Borg was in no
gentle mood today.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the gathering moved with one accord towards
the church and poured in. The bell called for the third
time—a strange, solitary sound in the quiet air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur and Ormarr secured their horses and went
straight into the church. They were the last to enter, save
for old Kata, who hobbled along, waving her coloured kerchief
in the air to ward off invisible ghosts and evil things.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur read the opening prayer, and the service proceeded
as usual, until Sera Ketill ascended into the pulpit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was in his usual seat in the choir. Alma sat at
his side. Ormarr had found a place in the nave, just in
front of the organ.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Sera Ketill appeared in the pulpit, a dead silence
filled the church, as if all had ceased to breathe. For a
moment the priest stood silent, with a thoughtful mien.
Then he spoke—a little unsteadily at first, and fumbling with
his fingers at the notes before him. But soon he gained
power, and spoke out strongly and in a clear, resonant voice.
His hands clutched the edge of the pulpit with such force
that the knuckles showed white.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Brethren in Christ,” he began, “before proceeding to
interpret the text for today, I have a painful duty to perform—a
painful duty indeed. Let me therefore fortify myself
by supplication. I ask you all to say with me the Lord’s
Prayer:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy
Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil: For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the
glory, for ever and ever. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Sera Ketill wiped his brow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes: Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory.
And we will serve Thee only. Grant us strength that no
earthly ties may keep us from Thee and Thy way. That
our duty to Thee may ever be set before all else; that we
may willingly take up our cross and bear it in patience as
did Thy well-beloved Son.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill paused a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Brethren in Christ, we all know how the Son of God
cleansed the Temple at Jerusalem. Today a like duty is
laid upon us, the meanest of His servants. To the Almighty,
this poor house of prayer is no less sacred than the great
Temple; it is the House of the Lord, and no evil must be
suffered to dwell therein. And those who have given offence
to God cannot be suffered to enter His House until they
have begged of Him forgiveness for their sins, kneeling before
him with a humble and a contrite heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is here in our midst an old man who is a cause of
offence among this congregation, together with his son, the
sharer of his sin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The son took to wife a woman out of his father’s house.
And the woman has given birth to a child that cannot be
the offspring of her husband. Whose, then, is the child?
It is said that the old man is the father. I have seen the
child, and I cannot but believe that it must have been born
earlier than is said. Indeed, I am certain of this. And my
wife has seen the child, and can testify to the same. The
woman, then, has borne a child in sin. But who is the father?</p>

<p class='c004'>“Until this matter is made clear, until the parentage of
this child is established according to the laws of the Church,
we cannot tolerate among us those from whom this offence
is come. We cannot suffer them to worship God under the
same roof.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now, Ørlygur à Borg, and you, Ormarr Ørlygsson,
I call on you, in the name of God, to leave this holy place.
Amen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma leaned over towards Ørlygur and grasped his arm.
From the commencement of her husband’s speech she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>divined his intention, and now in a moment she realized
what had been vague to her before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur sat motionless throughout his son’s denunciation,
but his brow was firmly knit, and a strange light shone in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Ketill finished, Ormarr rose to leave the church.
Passing by the pulpit, he looked straight at his brother;
both men were deadly pale. Ormarr stood still for a
moment, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are playing a dangerous game, brother Ketill.”
Then he passed on.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now Ørlygur rose to his feet, Alma still clinging to
his arm, and called out in a loud, firm voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ormarr!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr stopped, looked back, and strode to his father’s
side.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma still held the old man’s arm. She clung to him,
and begged imploringly: “Do not leave me here; take me
back with you to Borg. Let me come with you and stay
with you there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur patted her trembling hands, and said gently;
“Ormarr will look after you, my dear.” And to Ormarr
he said: “Go with her home, and protect her, whatever happens.
Do not let her leave Borg unless by her own desire.
Be kind to her, my son. And now go, both of you. I will
come presently.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Alma held Ormarr back, and they did not leave the
church.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had followed them down the aisle toward the
door. Then he turned back, not noticing that they remained
inside the church. When he had left them, old Kata emerged
from her corner, and going up to Ormarr, asked: “May I
come with you to Borg and stay?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma caught her hand, and Ormarr nodded in consent.
Alma was trembling pitifully; Ormarr and Kata had to support
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur à Borg walked back toward the pulpit, stopped in
front of it, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“This is the House of God. But it seems that the Evil
One has usurped His place. I am to be driven out from it—well
and good. But before I go, let me tell what all these
righteous folk are full of zeal to know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And pointing to the priest in the pulpit, he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is the father of the child.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Alma heard the old man’s words, it was as if the
inward tension of the past months had suddenly given way.
Her features relaxed, she ceased to tremble, and her eyes
lost their fire. She felt as if she were sinking into a sea of
mist. And then to nothingness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The light of her mind was suddenly extinguished, her soul
had taken flight, back to the eternity whence it had come.
Only her body remained, panting, unharmed, a living monument
to that which had gone, an empty dwelling, that has
not yet crumbled, though the last living thing it sheltered,
the last thought, is gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>A wave of astonishment swept through the congregation
at Ørlygur’s revelation. Then a moment after all was quiet
once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill was still in the pulpit, pale as a corpse. He
had reckoned with every possibility save only this; no form
of defence, no counter-attack, but he would have had his
answer ready. But this.... It was not like his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was all over now. The words that meant his destruction
were spoken. And yet he was still alive. The earth
had not swallowed him up, no fire had descended from heaven
to consume him. He was unhurt; ruined beyond help, yet
he stood there as if nothing had happened. It seemed somehow
ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur faced his son, speaking directly to him:</p>

<p class='c004'>“How could you do this thing? And how could ever God
permit it? How could He tolerate a hypocrite in His House?
My son, I do not hate you, and yet I say: Be thou accursed
until repentance and charity have filled your soul. Ay, I
curse my son, not because I hate him, but because of my
love for him. Accursed—be accursed until our Heavenly
Father shall have let the glory of His goodness penetrate into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>your soul, and the darkness of the Evil One give place to
light. May your soul never rest, and may it never leave its
earthly dwelling, until Almighty God has given the sign of
His forgiveness!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The congregation sat in awed silence while Ørlygur was
speaking. When the old man had finished, he turned to leave
the church. But he tottered, and would have fallen had he
not grasped at the side of a seat for support.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr hurried to his side, leaving Kata to look after
Alma. Ørlygur sank helpless into his son’s arms. The congregation
looked on as if spellbound; no one moved.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man put his hand to his heart and murmured;
“I am dying. Heavenly Father, into thy hands I commend
my spirit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr laid him down on the floor of the church, and stood
bending over him, at a loss what next to do. The old man
seemed trying to speak. Ormarr put his ear close to his
father’s mouth, and caught the words:</p>

<p class='c004'> “... home&nbsp;... to Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They were the last words Ørlygur à Borg ever uttered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr felt his father’s heart and pulse—it was all over.
Lifting the body tenderly in his arms, he carried it out of the
church.</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Kata, standing by the entrance, crossed herself and
muttered something about the ways of the Lord.... Then
to herself she added:</p>

<p class='c004'>“So it was <em>his</em> death the ravens came to tell!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Kata took the unconscious Alma by the hand and
followed after Ormarr and his burden.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they had left, an old peasant rose and walked out
of the church. Then the congregation followed, walking with
downcast eyes, a few only casting furtive glances in the
direction of the pulpit, where Sera Ketill stood.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr carried his father across the churchyard to the
horses, Kata and Alma following close behind. When he
saw his sister-in-law’s condition, he shivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Kata was watching him. “Ay,” she said, “her poor
troubled soul’s found rest at last. And we should thank the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Lord that He took her reason. Let me come and nurse her—she’ll
need no other help as long as I live.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was puzzled to think how he should get his father’s
body and the two women home, with but two horses for the
journey. Sleipnir could easily carry him and his father’s
body. With a side-saddle, Alma could have mounted the
second horse, Kata leading it. As it was, the women would
have to walk, and he must ride at a foot-pace the whole
way. There was nothing else to be done that he could
see.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was on the point of telling Kata his plan when he
perceived the congregation crowding round. The old peasant
who had first left the church came up to him, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will let us carry the old chief home to Borg?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr turned on him furiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have killed my father among you; not one of you
shall touch his body.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the old peasant would not give way. His voice was
thick with emotion as he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“We have done a great injustice to your father. You
will not forbid us now to make amends as far as we can.
Had he lived, we should have come to him, to ask his forgiveness.
And for all that you are his son, you know him little
if you think he would have sent us away unheard. He was
too generous for that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr saw that there were tears in the man’s eyes. He
glanced round the circle, and saw everywhere bowed heads
and evident distress. And suddenly he remembered his
father’s dream.</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” he said. “It is your right to pay him the last
honour on earth. Carry him home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A bier was found, and the party moved off, with Ormarr
at the head. Alma, with eyes staring blankly before her,
walked between him and old Kata.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the others, men, women, and children, followed on foot,
leading their horses. Never had the parish seen so impressive
a funeral train, nor such a numerous following.</p>

<p class='c004'>They moved but slowly, step by step, all the long road to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Borg, the men relieving one another at the bier. As soon
as the body was lifted up, they commenced with one accord to
sing the beautiful funeral hymn:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<i><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Alt eins og blomstrid eina.</span></i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They sang through all the verses, and when it was ended,
another hymn was sung; afterwards, the first again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Singing and sobbing, the procession moved on—a strange
sight to see. The birds circled round the train in silence,
forgetting for a moment their spring song. But the sky was
clear and blue as before.</p>

<p class='c004'>So they passed along the way. When they reached the
river, Ormarr took Alma and Kata in his arms and carried
them across. The men waded over likewise, leading their
horses; only the women and children crossed on horseback.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last they came to Borg. The body of the chief was
laid on a big table in the hall, and another hymn was sung.
The followers were about to move off, when Ormarr turned
to them and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have carried my father home, and I thank you. I
know that he was always your friend, and if you will accept
the friendship I offer you now, it would be as he wished.
I hope to hold the place he held amongst you—that of a
brother and friend. And if you have need of me in any
way, you know where to find me. You must be tired and
hungry now. If you will break bread under my roof now,
before you return, then I take it that the good-will that was
of old between Borg and its neighbours is there still.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When he had finished speaking, he had to shake hands
with all. At his suggestion the women went out to the kitchen
and pantries to prepare food.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was late, and all had been well cared for, when the guests
rode away. But, before they left, the whole staff of servants
and hands who had been at Borg that spring had returned,
having obtained release from their later masters, and permission
from Ormarr to re-enter their former service.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alma never recovered. She wandered about like a living
corpse. Old Kata nursed her as well as she could, consoling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>herself and others with the thought that she did not suffer.
Alma was no longer conscious of joy or pain.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Sera Ketill stood in the pulpit, watching his people leave
the church. He made no movement, but followed all with
observant eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>He saw how the scene had affected his wife, and that she
had sought refuge with his father. And he understood that
he had lost her for ever. Then, marking the change in her
expression, he suspected the truth: that she had lost her
reason on hearing her husband denounced by his own
father.</p>

<p class='c004'>He listened to his father’s curse, and saw him sink to
the ground and die. He heard the congregation singing
hymns outside the church. Then gradually all sound died
away&nbsp;... the last he heard was a vague murmur—fragments
of the singing borne by errant winds towards him through
the open door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still he remained in the pulpit, leaning on his arms, as
if nothing had happened. He did not think. A scornful
smile seemed frozen on his lips; he suddenly realized that
he was sneering, and wondered how long he had been doing
so. And then it came to him painfully that he could not rest
until he knew what it was all about; he must wake, and look
at things and see. And suddenly it dawned upon him that
he was sneering at himself. He drew himself up and laughed
aloud, as if in an endeavour to break the terrible stillness of
the church. He marked the harsh, uncanny sound of his own
laughter. And, stepping down from the pulpit, he left the
church.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the churchyard he could see the funeral procession
moving towards Borg. He watched it for a while, tried to
laugh, but in vain. He went home, and found the house
empty. Looked into the servants’ quarters—the place was
deserted. He went out again and searched about outside.</p>

<p class='c004'>Coming back to the house, after making sure that there
was not a soul to be seen, he found a dog beside the door.
The animal slunk away. Ketill spoke to it softly, beckoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to it, trying with friendly voice and gesture to call it to
him. But the dog would not come, and finally ran away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill looked after it without any sign of emotion. Then
he went indoors and sat down at his writing-table. He sat
there all through the day, still wearing his vestments.
Thoughts crowded in upon him—thoughts that he could not
drive away.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had sinned against life, taking the gift of life in vain.
And now he was alone, an outcast, rejected and despised by
all. Even a dog disowned him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had sinned against God, taking His name in vain.
The House of God was closed to him. Alone, cursed by his
father and abandoned by his God!</p>

<p class='c004'>He had sinned against love; he had used his utmost efforts
to ruin the lives of two innocent women. God had intervened
to save them: the one through the love of human beings, the
other by taking away her reason. And he—he was left alone
and shunned by all. The world was full of love around him,
on every side were human beings, his fellow-creatures, loving
and being loved. To him only love was denied; for him alone
there was no kindly thought in any single heart. All who
knew him hated and despised him. He had crushed the
flower of love underfoot—it would bloom no more on his
way, nor gladden him by its fragrance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alone. And what should he do now? Why could he not
sink to the earth and die? Why was not his body given to
the worms? Why could he not rot away, and return to dust?
What had he to do with life now? Or was it that life had
not yet done with him?</p>

<p class='c004'>He made no effort to check the current of his thoughts,
but suffered them to come and go as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tears flowed down his cheeks. There was a strange sensation
at his heart now, as if despair and loneliness were to
become a source of joy; something akin to what the earth
must feel when spring casts loose the fetters of winter.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat on. The faint, scarcely perceptible northern twilight
crept into the room; he did not mark it. He had forgotten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the existence of time. His only thought was that he was
alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>And suddenly he fell on his knees. On hands and knees
he crept out of the room, through the passage, out into the
courtyard and across the enclosure, through the churchyard
up to the door of the church.</p>

<p class='c004'>He pressed his forehead against the granite steps, and
sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun showed in the north, a dull red glow, with the
sky deeper and darker round it. Farther off hung clouds,
a delicate rose, neatly and regularly in tier upon tier. Night,
but the sun was there. The meadows were thickly veiled with
dew. All nature was at peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>But before the door of one poor dark little church lay
the priest, his forehead pressed against the cold stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>And for the first time in his life he prayed from his heart
to the God in whom he had never before believed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Peace, Lord, give peace to my soul!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But there was no peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill lay there long, sobbing and praying. Then, rising,
he stood with bowed head and clasped hands, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord, I will seek Thee and Thy peace. My life shall be
a prayer and a cry to Thee. And Thou who hast said: ‘Seek,
and ye shall find; ask, and it shall be given unto you’—Thou
wilt not deny me peace. A humble and a contrite heart....”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>A grey, dull day—not a glimpse of the sun since
morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>A man came hobbling along the little-used path,
a solitary figure under the leaden sky. The clouds hung so
low that it seemed as if the heavens had fallen, and were
supported only by the mountain peaks on the horizon. A
grey, dull day—and the man’s spirit was grey and dull within
him. All that the day had given him was a fragment of a
song that had sprung into his mind; he hummed it half-consciously
as he went along.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“No sun over the sand,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Waste, waste.</div>
      <div class='line'>No eagle over land,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Dead, dead.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>His voice was deep and hollow-sounding; in its depth a
ring of loneliness and unsatisfied longing. There seemed a
power of fate and sorrow behind it, as behind the dull roar of
the sea. The eternal restlessness of life, and the boundless
seeking of the soul quivered in this old man’s voice. Strong,
yet soft, its tones had power at times to move those who
heard to sadness in themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt a peculiar comfort in the sound of his own voice
when wandering thus alone; and he was a man who wandered
much alone. And for all that he carried no heavy burden,
his steps often faltered.</p>

<p class='c004'>His right leg was crippled, which made journeying none
the easier; the stout staff he carried was but a poor substitute
for a sound limb.</p>

<p class='c004'>Despite his infirmity, he tramped the country far and wide.
Just now, he was on his way across the chain of hills to the
north of Hofsfjordur, known as the Dark Mountains.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>He had never been in Hofsfjordur. All the other districts
round he had visited many a time in his twenty years of
vagabond life, but somehow he had always passed by this.
If any asked him why, he might answer that it was because
of the bad roads. Yet he was well used to roads that were
no better.</p>

<p class='c004'>However it might be, this time he was on his way. The
day was drawing to a close, and he had still far to go. The
night would be dark, and hopeless then to find his way; there
was nothing for it but to find some sheltered spot where he
could rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was thoroughly tired, and his lameness was more marked
than usual; his sound leg too was aching from its unfair
share of the work. He rocked along uncertainly, like a
machine on the verge of breakdown, or a windmill making its
last rotations before a calm.</p>

<p class='c004'>His heavy coat dragged like the wings of a wounded bird.
It was a picture well in keeping with the landscape, the man
with his long white beard, the tangled grey hair showing
below a big soft hat of the indeterminate colour of age.
From beneath his bushy brows showed the glimpse of an eye—he
had but one—almost unearthly in its intelligence and
penetrating glance. His whole appearance, with his beggar’s
pouch and limping gait, presented an almost unreal effect,
harmonizing to a striking degree with the surroundings. He
seemed to be in his element in this waste tract, beneath the
low-lying clouds that at times almost enveloped him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He limped on, a monarch in the realm of mist and solitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there was nothing of power in his thoughts. He simply
felt at home here, and in no way disheartened at the
prospect of a night in the open.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again and again he hummed his fragment of a song. It
was his way to make up such refrains as he walked, humming
them hour after hour to while away the tedium of the road.
Also, it was a form of expression, giving relief to his feelings
and easing his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last, after innumerable repetitions of his melancholy
chant, he fell silent. Not all at once, but stopping for a little,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>then taking it up and stopping again, with longer and longer
pauses between. And his glance grew dull, his brow wrinkled
and furrowed. Night was at hand; he stopped on a sudden
as if to make a survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here am I, a worm in all creation,” he muttered. “And
the day has left me up on a desolate hill. Make haste, Eye,
and find us a place to rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gradually the fog lifted, and the sky cleared. The darkness,
however, grew more intense, and the contours of the hills
were soon almost indistinguishable.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wanderer glanced around, searching for some corner
that might offer some little shelter. Comfort and warmth
were not to be expected in these regions. But at length he
spied two boulders leaning one against the other. “Like
brothers,” he thought to himself, and added aloud:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good evening, brothers!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sense of loneliness vanished, and his heart was glad;
he seemed to feel already a bond of kindliness between him
and this his night’s abode. Pleasanter thoughts rose in his
mind, and he gripped his faithful staff with a heartiness that
might once have been extended to his fellow-men. Now,
the staff was almost his only friend. He spoke to it aloud,
thanking it for help during the day; he even felt somewhat
shamed at not having done so before. He dug and scraped
away a heap of moss and little stones, to fill the northern
opening between the boulders, making a kind of cave.</p>

<p class='c004'>This done, he opened his wallet and took out some food,
given him earlier in the day by some kindly soul, and ate
it, lying in the shelter of his cave. When the meal was
finished, he rose to his knees, and hid his face for a moment
in his hands, as if silently returning thanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then after some shifting about, he curled himself up in
the most convenient position within the cramped space at
his disposal. He patted the hard stones, and spoke, half
aloud, as his thoughts came.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Feel strangely happy this evening. Not lonely now, just
at home. Nice soft sand here to lie on. And the stones
that lie there saying nothing, they are like friends. Battered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>about, like me, by sun and storms and time. Ay, we’ve much
in common, for all they stay still and I’m for ever moving
from place to place. Who knows—perhaps this night may be
my longest at last. Must come some time—some night be
night for ever. If so, ’tis a good place for old bones to
rest. Maybe there comes One tonight to take the unrest out
of my soul and give me the peace I’ve sought. If so, why,
call up all the worms and creeping things that live on flesh,
and make a feast of me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Drowsiness crept over him; he closed his eyes and prayed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord, see the end of one more day in Thy service. Lord,
may it please Thee soon to lift the burden from my shoulders—the
burden of sin. Lord, Thou knowest my heart is full
of penitence and distress; Lord, grant me soon Thy peace.
Amen!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He ceased, and lay for a while without opening his eyes.
Then, turning over on his side, he huddled himself up for
warmth, and resigned himself to what the night might bring—rest,
or the fever of sleeplessness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Morning broke with the clear brightness of an
autumn sky above the hills.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the first sight of dawn, the old man limped
out from his cave, beat his hands together, and stamped
his sound leg repeatedly, to get some warmth into his body.
And as he did so, he thought:</p>

<p class='c004'>“So! Once more Death has passed me by. Not worth
taking....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, penitently, he whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord, Thy will be done! Thanks be to Thee for the night
that is gone, and for all trials that are sent from Thee. Be
not angry, Lord, if I long for the peace of Death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun came up, and the man sat down on a stone, bared
his head and stretched out his hands to meet the warmth of
the first rays; he smiled towards the light, that gave but
little warmth as yet.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the first cold of waking had passed, he ate his last
scraps of food, and prepared to move.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mood of last night and his gloomy thoughts seemed
strange to remember now; he smiled involuntarily at the
difference between his feeling then and now.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never twice alike,” he murmured. “What’s truth, I
wonder? Can there be any truth in thoughts and feelings
that change between dark and dawn? Where’s the note that
lasts and does not change?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to go, when something made him pause. And,
smiling indulgently at himself for his foolishness, he stooped
and picked away the moss and stones with which he had
closed the opening the night before. Then he patted the two
rocks that had sheltered him, and went on his way with an
easier mind. Who could say? Perhaps they were lonely
there, and would have been sorry to feel the way barred to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the passage of the wind that told so many things as it sang
through the sharp-edged cleft.</p>

<p class='c004'>He limped off, moving stiffly at first, his limbs still feeling
the cold. He found the path he had left the night before in
his search for a resting-place, and went on his way towards
Hofsfjordur.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun rose higher in the heavens, and dried the dew
from the rocks, warming their surface where they faced it,
while the northward sides were still dark with moisture. In
the shade, the moss glistened with dew. As far as eye could
see, there was no growth save the brown and green of moss.
But the old wanderer felt quite content; he was at home
among these rock-strewn hills, so rich in their weird grouping
and fantastic outlines. He was among friends here, and
as he passed the massive boulders he touched them with his
hand caressingly, grateful for the warmth that passed into
his blood. The sun had given it, and they passed it on.</p>

<p class='c004'>He reached Langeryg, a narrow ridge between two steep
ravines, and stopped to look around him. Farther on was a
meadow of pale green grass, but not a living soul was to be
seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly he went on his way, keeping carefully to the middle
between the steep and dangerous precipices on either hand.
A sinister place this, and of ill repute, perilous especially in
mist or darkness. Even now, in the light of day, the wind
moaned dismally round the sharp rocks, to the one side, that
known as Death’s Cliff, though, strangely enough, no sound
came from the other, that was called the Silent Cliff. There
was a legend current that the two had been daughters of a
king—one good, the other wicked, one dark, the other fair.
And the silent chasm was the good princess who sat listening
in horror to the evil doings of her sister. And it was said
that if any could be found to cast himself voluntarily over
the Silent Cliff, he would escape unharmed, and the ravines
would close for ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half-way along the track, the old man felt tempted to peer
down over the edge of Death’s Cliff. Mastering a feeling of
dread, he crept cautiously to the brink, and looked down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>but could discern nothing in the darkness below. Suddenly
a great black bird fluttered up out of the gloom, and he
started back. The bird uttered a hoarse cry—and the man
smiled to himself. Only a raven, that had been to visit
the princess—or perhaps to see if there were any unfortunate
creatures there on which to feast.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a sigh of relief he drew back from his perilous position,
and threw himself down on a patch of grass to rest.
Grass was a welcome thing among these barren hills, and the
sight of it gladdened him. He found himself studying each
little stalk as if it were a wonder to be remembered.</p>

<p class='c004'>And suddenly tears rose to his eyes; his lips quivered, and
he murmured:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, there are many little joys in life....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced down the path ahead; first a flat stretch of
grass, and then over a long, stony rise. There at the top
he knew was a cairn, from which one could look out over
Hofsfjordur.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somehow or other, he felt disinclined to go on, and yet
there was something that urged him forward. He felt nervous
and anxious, as a boy about to undertake some responsible
task for the first time.</p>

<p class='c004'>When at last he reached the summit of the slope, he stopped
and looked down. There it was at last, the shore where he
had spent his childhood. There lay the blue fjord, the rockiness, the glittering stream, the grassy slopes—all that he had
so often thought of with affectionate longing. Ay, he had
come to love it all—since he had left it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tears dimmed his vision as he looked. And yet he was
happy. He had crossed the boundary now; he was coming
home.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>He had been standing for some time leaning against
the cairn, when suddenly he heard a dog barking.
He turned in the direction of the sound, and
perceived a young man approaching. At sight of a fellow-creature,
he forgot all else.</p>

<p class='c004'>The newcomer called to his dog, and the animal was
silent at once. But the voice of the stranger went to the
wanderer’s heart as had never a voice before.</p>

<p class='c004'>He limped towards him, and held out his hand, a glad
smile on his wrinkled face.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two exchanged greetings, and stood for a moment
taking stock of each other. The evident emotion of the
older man was not lost upon the stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A beautiful day,” said the latter after a pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do your sheep stray as far afield as this?” asked the
other. He seemed to be taking in every detail of the
stranger’s appearance as he spoke. He listened, moreover,
rather to his voice than to his words, though the
other was not aware of this—as little as he guessed that the
old man had seen his face many years ago, and recognized
him now.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who are you?” asked the young man, somewhat ill
at ease.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A poor wanderer,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And your name?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man hesitated. “My name,” he said at last—“there’s
none remembers it for aught but ill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you going now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Going? I go from place to place, and live by grace
of God and my fellow-men. I am going to Hofsfjordur.
I have never been there before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you will come to Borg, no doubt?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Yes,” said the old man, with a queer smile. “I shall
come to Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have not seen any sheep on your way? Or any
sign?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay, naught but a raven flying up from below Death’s
Cliff. ’Tis the only living creature I have seen. Were
you going farther?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I can see as far as I need from here. We can
go down together; I have looked enough for today.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you lost many sheep?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Only a white lamb with black feet and head. It
was a sensible beast, and strong, when it went up with
the rest in the spring—I can hardly think any fox could
have harmed it. But it was a favourite, and I must
find it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are from Borg, then?” queried the old man, looking
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. My name is Ørlygur.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ørlygur the younger, that will be?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no other now. Ørlygur, my grandfather, died
many years ago.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, that is true. He died in the church at Hof. I was
there at the time. True....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you <em>have</em> been here before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No—no. It was—my other self that was here then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young man seemed busy with thoughts of his own;
he took no notice of the strange reply. He stood gazing
for some moments into distance, then turned and looked
searchingly at the wanderer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you must have known Sera Ketill? He is dead,
too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I knew Sera Ketill,” repeated the old man. And
in a curiously toneless voice he went on: “He is dead, too.
Yes....”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a long pause. The young man realized that
he could not here, in broad daylight, ask all he would of
this stranger, who, he perceived, could tell him much.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Such talk was for the dark, when men can speak together
without reserve.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you come back with me now, to Borg?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I must go elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you will come to Borg? You give me your word?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I give you my word. No beggar ever came this way and
did not ask for alms at Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was somewhat embarrassed, and said in a kindly
tone:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me give you some food now. We can share it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Heaven bless you,” said the old man.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked down the slope together, and found a seat
on a grassy mound. Ørlygur opened his haversack and
took out first a new pair of shoes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take these, will you not?” he asked shyly. “Yours are
badly worn. I brought these with me in case my own gave
out. But they will last me home easily.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man took them gladly, and let his fingers glide
caressingly along the clean soles. He put them on, and
looked up with deep gratitude in his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fine shoes,” he said, and laughed happily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does not take much to please you,” said Ørlygur,
with a smile. “And now let us have something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They ate in silence, each occupied with his own thoughts.
Ørlygur was watching his companion, and noticed now for
the first time that one eye was closed. The man’s appearance
seemed less repulsive now than at first. Evidently,
one who had seen better days.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the old man had finished he wiped his mouth and
murmured something to himself, then added aloud:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks be to God.” And he reached out for Ørlygur’s
hand in thanks, looking at it closely as he did so.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man’s touch had a curious effect upon Ørlygur, at
once pleasing and the reverse. He was well used to shaking
hands with men, whether friends or strangers, and
did so usually without a thought. But with this beggar
it was different; he felt an impulse to embrace him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>at the same time shrank from giving him his hand at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked on side by side, but for a long time no
word was spoken. Often the old man stopped, and leaned
on his staff to rest. At length they reached the point
where the road branched off to Nordurdalur. Here they
halted, and sat down without a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will cross the stream now, I take it, and take the
shorter road. I am going down alongside the stream. I
can reach Bolli in an hour’s time. There is still some one
living there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must know the neighbourhood well,” said Ørlygur.
“Yes; a widow lives there with her daughter.” And he
blushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man noticed it and smiled. “Here is a young
man who is still a child,” he thought. “Cannot speak of
the widow’s daughter without blushing. If I had not been
a stranger he would not have spoken of her at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Aloud, he said: “I hope they’ll give me leave to sleep
in a barn tonight. You’re not going that way yourself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked aside. “No,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall I tell them I’ve met you—by way of greeting?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur did not look up. The old man rose and came
towards him. “Good-bye,” he said, offering his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And thank you for good company.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye and thanks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur sat looking after the old man as he went. Then,
suddenly springing to his feet, he ran after him and asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you not tell me your name?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Men call me ‘Guest the One-eyed,’” answered the
wanderer quietly, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur said nothing, but his face showed that the name
was not unknown to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye, again, Ørlygur à Borg.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye, Guest One-eyed, and God be with you,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>answered Ørlygur reverently, pressing the other’s hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wanderer went on his way, following the course of
the stream. Ørlygur watched him till he was out of sight,
and stood for a long while looking down the way he had
gone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The sun had vanished behind the western heights
when Ørlygur at last roused himself from gazing
down the valley. The figure had disappeared long
since.</p>

<p class='c004'>The name of Guest the One-eyed had always seemed
to him a part of some fantastic story; now, however, it
had become a reality; he had seen and spoken to the
man.</p>

<p class='c004'>He knew that this Guest was a wandering beggar, and
had heard many stories current concerning him. He knew
also that Guest the One-eyed had never before visited Hofsfjordur—possibly
it was this fact which had led him to
regard the stories as stories only, without reality. Now
that he had learned that the man had apparently lived
in Hofsfjordur before, under another name, it seemed
strange to him—it had never struck him before that the
name of Guest the One-eyed must have had some natural
origin.</p>

<p class='c004'>As with all young and simple folk who had heard of
Guest the One-eyed, Ørlygur felt an affection for the
singular character of report. Many were the instances on
record of kindness and courtesy shown by the wanderer in
his journeyings. He had lost one eye in saving a child
from a burning farm; his crippled leg was the result of his
having flung himself in the way of a sledge that was hurrying
towards a dangerous cliff—the life he had thus saved
being that of no more romantic personage than an elderly
and by no means beautiful servant girl. This latter incident
had been the cause of some ill-placed amusement
among the peasantry, for it was known that the girl had
been merely making a foolhardy attempt to win the heart
of one of the labourers near by. Her rescuer, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>before leaving the farm, made it his business to see that the
marriage was duly accomplished.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur knew, also, that Guest the One-eyed had a peculiar
faculty of getting over difficulties and removing misunderstandings;
in more than one instance he had been the means
of ending an irreconcilable feud and establishing firm friendship
in its stead.</p>

<p class='c004'>A legendary hero in real life, and gifted with wisdom far
beyond that of his fellows. Yet he never used his powers
for his own advantage. Nobler than those around him,
he was nevertheless content to tramp the country in rags,
with a beggar’s staff. In point of intelligence, he seemed
fitted to be the adviser of kings; yet he chose to live alone,
and to seek his rest in barns and outhouses. All of which
led folk to look upon him as the personification of something
beneficent—the spirit of kindliness and good-will. And
Ørlygur himself had felt the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt a great desire to follow after the old man; a craving
for adventure within him even suggested the idea of
throwing in his lot with him, and sharing his wanderings.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as the sun went down, he woke from his dreams and,
pulling himself together, made his way rapidly towards
home.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half-way over the stream he stopped suddenly; the water
seemed like a flood of gold pouring towards him, glittering
with strange reflections in the evening light. And the play
of colour, with the murmur of the stream, held him for a
moment entranced. Was it a dream, or had he really met
Guest the One-eyed in the flesh?</p>

<p class='c004'>Once across, however, the spell was broken, and Ørlygur
was a boy again, filled with no more romantic fancy for the
moment than an impulse to run races with his dog. He
called to the animal, and they raced away, tearing along at
top speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he ran, Ørlygur was conscious that he was eager to
get home and relate his adventure; to tell of his conversation
with the One-eyed Guest, and announce the arrival of
the hero.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>He raced on homeward, leaving the dog far behind. The
animal followed at its best, till it saw him leap the fence
of the enclosure, when it gave up and lay down panting
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur likewise could run no more, and slackened to a
walk. Noticing his foster-father approaching, he made towards
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr Ørlygsson had seen the lad come tearing down the
slope, his hat off, and his hair streaming in the wind. He
knew how the boy delighted in long walks and violent outbursts
of energy, but this exuberance of spirits caused him
some uneasiness at times—he knew that a day would come
when the natural safety-valve of youth would no longer
suffice. Yet he could not suppress a smile of pleasure at
sight of the handsome lad as he raced away at a speed which
bade fair to tire even his horses and dogs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Often he reflected how like the boy was to his father—the
same fair hair, the same blue eyes, the same splendid build;
the figure of a young god.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he thought, with a mingling of unconscious love and
conscious hate, of his brother Ketill, who had disappeared
the night after that terrible scene that had caused his father’s
death and lost his wife her reason. It was said
that he had drowned himself—he had last been seen on the
cliffs near the fjord. True, the body had never been recovered.
Still, it might have been carried out to sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>After the revelation of that day, when the facts had been
made common knowledge, and seeing that Ketill had disappeared,
in all likelihood never to return, Ormarr had
ceased to give out Ørlygur, Ketill’s and Runa’s child, as his
own. He and Runa had continued to live as man and wife,
but no children had been born to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>They lived peacefully and happily at the farm, with
never an unkind word between them. At all times, whether
they spoke or were silent, there was a mutual bond of perfect
confidence and affection between them. Life had
brought them together in a strange and merciless fashion,
but the innate good sense and nobility of both had turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>all to the good. They knew that they had never been lovers
in the sense in which love is generally understood, yet, as
the years passed, there grew up between them a happiness
of each in each that filled their lives. And their mutual
trust gave them a surer foundation on which to rest than
any lovers’ love could give.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur rarely gave a thought to the fact that Ormarr
was not his real father. He knew it, because Ormarr had
once, in the presence of Runa, told him how matters stood.
No details had been given, but the facts were plainly stated:
Ormarr had promised to tell him the whole story some day,
if he wished. But Ørlygur perceived that the subject was a
painful one, and had asked no further since.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had it not been from fragments of information gathered
in course of time from one or another outside the home, he
would have known but little. What he did know made towards
the conclusion that his father had been a bad man,
who had wrought harm to his own kin. But strangely
enough, he, Ørlygur, did not suffer thereby. The misfortunes
that had come after seemed to have wiped away, as
it were, the stain on the family honour, and as years went
by, the recollection of Sera Ketill seemed gradually to lose
its association with the house of Borg. The story of Sera
Ketill lived on—a gruesome tale enough in itself. But it
had become a thing apart.</p>

<p class='c004'>And Ørlygur, growing up at Borg, became one of the
family there, until it was almost forgotten that he was in
any way related to his father, Sera Ketill of unblessed memory.
Ørlygur was aware of this, and at times could feel a
kind of remorse at the thought—for, after all, his father was
his father.... And, as he grew up, he tried to picture
to himself what his father had really been. In his inmost
heart he could not quite believe him so utterly evil as report
made out.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there was no one whom he could ask—no one, indeed,
to whom he could even speak on the subject at all. He
could not bring himself to open a painful subject with his
foster-father or his mother. There was only old Kata, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>faithful attendant of the poor witless Danish Lady. And
Kata’s replies to his questioning were always wrapped up
in mysterious, incomprehensible allusions. Ørlygur, in common
with others, regarded her as entering on her second
childhood, though she was sound and active as ever in body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was still out of breath when he reached Ormarr.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the latter, “did you find the lamb? You
look very pleased with yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Ørlygur. “But I found—whom do you think?
Guest the One-eyed! Right up at the very edge of the pastures,
in the hills. And I went with him as far as Nordura.
I didn’t know who he was till we said good-bye. And I
gave him my shoes, and he is wearing them now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur’s delight and pride at this last fact were so evident
that Ormarr could not help smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why didn’t you bring him back home with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is coming. He promised faithfully he would. He
was too tired now. Said he was going down the stream to
one of the nearest farms there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr did not fail to remark that the boy had avoided
mentioning Bolli, but he made no sign of having noticed
anything. He had an idea that Ørlygur cherished a fancy
for the daughter there, but it seemed wiser to wait before
taking any definite action. He was not at all pleased with
the idea of a match between Ørlygur and the child of the
so-called “widow” at Bolli. But he was loth to interfere
with the boy’s affairs—after all, he was of an age to choose
for himself. And Ormarr knew too well that the men of
his race were apt to be headstrong in affairs of the heart.
On the other hand, if he were mistaken—if the affair were
not really serious, his interference would do no good. If
the damage were already done, and Ørlygur had made up
his mind, then there was nothing to be done but wait and
see.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur himself did not know whether his parents were
aware of his affection for Snebiorg, the girl from Bolli. But
he was convinced that they would not agree with his choice.
Even if they did not oppose it, he knew it would pain them.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Up to now, his will and conscience had always been in
accord with theirs. In this case he was quite clear as to his
own feelings, but was loth to bring matters to a head. There
was time enough—no definite promise had as yet been given
on either side, though there was certainly a tacit understanding
between them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and Ørlygur walked across the enclosure together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what else did he say—the old man?” asked Ormarr.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was at a loss for an answer. He could not
remember anything else of importance, and it seemed somehow
unsatisfactory to have met the celebrated vagabond,
renowned for his wisdom, and bring back no utterance
worthy of remark. He said nothing—and Ormarr did not
press the question, but walked beside him with the quiet,
peculiar smile that had become characteristic of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when they reached the house, Ørlygur found himself
once more a person of importance. Old Kata came hobbling
towards him, and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have met him, and spoken. And felt joy of the
meeting—more than with any other you have ever met.
The Lord is great, and our eyes are blind. Yes; he will
come now, and all will be well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Kata hobbled off again to her mistress, whom she never left
for any length of time.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men stood watching her with a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She still has the gift, you see,” observed Ormarr. “No
need to tell her that you had met with Guest the One-eyed
in the mountains.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Alma dragged on her timeless, feelingless existence
under old Kata’s care. Age had left no mark on
her, though it was twenty years now since the
tragic event that had deprived her of her reason. In the
world about her there had been changes: those who had
been in the prime of life at that time were now aged and
infirm; the children of those days were grown. But Alma
was to all appearances the same as on the day when she had
left the church at Hof, released from suffering by the breakdown
of all capacity to feel or understand. She looked a
trifle healthier—less pale, that was all.</p>

<p class='c004'>And her life now had, despite its essential monotony, a
certain variation of a sort. She smiled happily when the
sun shone, but wept when the clouds hid it from her sight.
Her joys were those of childhood—fine weather, dumb animals,
flowers, and the presence of certain chosen friends.
There were some of her fellow-creatures whom she loved,
without knowing why. Others she disliked no less distinctly,
and contact with them would render her depressed
for days. Strangers, in particular, invariably troubled her
mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>In course of time, people had come to attribute this discrimination
to a strange instinct that had taken the place
of the ordinary human intelligence she no longer possessed.
She was still spoken of as the Danish Lady at Hof, though
for years she had not set her foot outside the limits of Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>She spoke but little. It seemed as if she had forgotten
not only her native tongue, but also the little Icelandic she
had ever learnt. She picked up odd words and sentences,
however, uttering them afterwards incoherently. And she
had a kind of language of her own invention—a combination
of curious expressions and strange gestures, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>those about her learned to understand. Old Kata was an
adept in this mode of intercourse, and pleased her mistress
by her quickness of understanding.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two women occupied one room, with two windows, in
which they had their favourite seats. They would sit there
for hours, old Kata with her knitting, and Alma gazing at
the world outside, and following with childish interest anything
that might be happening within view. For the most
part, they were silent, but now and again passers-by might
hear them exchanging words in their own unintelligible
form of speech.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had little to do with others, though Alma knew
all the servants and farm hands on the place. All loved
her, and towards old Kata, too, the general feeling was one
of kindly regard.</p>

<p class='c004'>On Sundays they joined the circle for Bible reading or
singing, after which coffee was handed round, Alma playing
the part of hostess. It was one of the small recurring
pleasures in her life, and both she and Kata found an ever-new
delight in the arrangement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes the master, Ormarr Ørlygsson, if so disposed,
would bring out his violin and treat his people to an entertainment.
He invariably began with merry tunes, and finished
with strange, heart-stirring themes; the simple listeners
knew nothing of the great composers, but the music had
its own effect on them, and often brought tears to the eyes of
the more impressionable amongst them.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he had played thus, Ormarr would leave the room
abruptly; the rest, sitting in silence, would hear him leave
the house. And then the party broke up, each to his work
or play.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Ormarr went off alone into the hills. At times he
might be seen pacing to and fro; sometimes he would find
some spot where he could lie and rest, but he never returned
to the farm until all had retired for the night. There were
always two, however, who waited his return. One was old
Kata, who sat by the window till she saw or heard him
back again—sat weeping, though he never dreamed of any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>such sympathy on her part. Not till she knew that he was
safely within doors—had fought out that day’s fight with
his God, as she put it to herself—would she go to rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other was his wife, lying awake in bed till he came.
No words were spoken when he returned; in silence he lay
down at her side, drawing close to her, with one arm round
her neck. Lying thus, rest would come to him and he could
sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only other event in the life of Alma and her aged
nurse was when visitors came to the place. All invariably
came in to pay their respects to the Danish Lady however
brief their stay or how pressing their errand might be.
Some did so from a natural desire to show their sympathy
with one afflicted by God; others from a secret fear that
God would punish them if they did not. And Alma seemed
able to distinguish between those who came of their own
kind will and those who merely obeyed a custom they feared
to break.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Guest the One-eyed limped wearily along by
the side of the stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>The path he followed wound with many turns,
following the course of the water, and in places quite near
to the edge, the bank sometimes overhanging the riverbed
below. At one spot the river actually tunnelled its way underground
for some few yards, leaving a kind of natural
bridge above. When he reached this spot the wanderer knew
that he was not far from Bolli.</p>

<p class='c004'>His thoughts were busy with recollection of the young
man he had met up in the hills.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So that was he,” he thought to himself. “A handsome
lad, strong and manly, and of a kindly heart, by his eyes.”
He thought of the evident pleasure with which the boy had
given him the shoes and shared his food with him. Ay, a
true son of his race—little fear of <em>his</em> bringing sorrow upon
Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the old man’s heart beat faster at the thought that
he would soon see the girl whom Ørlygur had chosen for
his bride. His knowledge of men had enabled him to read
clearly enough the signs of Ørlygur’s feeling; it was evident,
also, that the two young people understood each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>He forgot his weariness and hurried on.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, rounding a bend of the river, he came suddenly
upon the tiny homestead, a cluster of small buildings on a
little piece of rising ground. A thin smoke rose from a
chimney—that must be from the open hearth in the kitchen.
The ground outside was marked by heaps of hay, in regular
rows; a solitary horse was grazing on the hillside, and a
few sheep nosed about among the rocks down by the
river.</p>

<p class='c004'>For some minutes he stood looking over the place. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>this was where the two women passed their quiet lives.
Mother and daughter, living for some reason apart from
their neighbours. The old wanderer knew well enough
that it was often not the worst of human kind that chose to
live aloof from their fellows.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he approached the house, a dog ran out barking
angrily. Immediately after, a young woman appeared. At
first sight of the strange figure coming towards her, she
turned as if to go indoors again, but changed her mind and
advanced to meet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here is one who is tired,” said she. “Can I help you,
old man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>And she took his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks, blessed child,” said the old man, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl looked up at his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh—you have only one eye!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” answered the stranger, with a chuckle. “Worms
couldn’t wait for it. They’ll have the other one soon, and
the rest of me with it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should not talk like that,” said the girl, with childish
displeasure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed changed his tone. “Yes,” he said
earnestly. “You are young and wise, and I am old and
foolish. ’Tis not a matter for jesting. What is your name,
child?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Snebiorg is my name. Mother calls me Bagga, but I
don’t let other people call me that—or only one other, perhaps,
if he cares to. And you perhaps, too, because you are
not like other folk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“One other—if he cares to? Don’t you know whether
he cares to or not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No—for I have never spoken to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—are you not lovers, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you mean to say you have never spoken—only
written letters to each other?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Written? No.” Bagga looked up in surprise. “We
have looked at each other. Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>There was a strange earnestness in the old man’s voice as
he answered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely it is enough. And are you very fond of him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked on in silence. Guest the One-eyed wished
to have his message given before going into the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have seen him,” he said. “And I was to bring you
greeting from him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stopped still and clasped her hand to her breast.
The colour had risen to her cheeks as she spoke of her lover;
now she turned pale. The old man looked at her intently,
taking in her fine profile, her beautiful eyes and lovely hair,
the fineness of her figure. He realized that these two were
destined for each other; that they <em>must</em> love each other at
first sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga could hardly speak at first. After a while she
said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have spoken to him? Is it long ago? What did
he say? Did he ask you to bring me greeting?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you said so just now!” She looked at him with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I asked if I should bring you greeting, and he said yes.
And I read more in his eyes. Can you guess what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That he loves you, and is for ever thinking of you.
That he will always be true to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That I knew long ago. But how could you know that
it was he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It needs not long to find out that. Shall I tell you his
name?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” answered the girl, colouring deeply. “Did he
say anything else? Was he looking for a lamb that had
strayed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, a favourite lamb, and he was afraid some fox
might have harmed it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga looked serious.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“It is here,” she said hesitatingly. “It strayed over
here early in the summer, and I have been keeping it with
our sheep. I knew it was his, and I could not bear to part
with it. But tonight, when every one is asleep, I will take
it over to Borg. Then he will find it in the morning, and
be glad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She smiled with pleasure at the thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t you remember any more he said? Did you have
a long talk with him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes—but I have forgotten. He gave me these shoes I
am wearing now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga was immediately keenly interested in the old man’s
shoes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you have not worn a hole in them yet. But, if
you have, I will mend them for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” answered the old man, with a quiet smile. “I am
sorry to say there is nothing to mend.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga blushed again, but added quickly, “But you can
let me set them in oil for you tonight, then they will be
soft in the morning. You will stay here tonight, will you
not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gladly, if you will house me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had reached the door of the house, and Bagga led him
through a dark passage into the room. Seated on a bed was
an elderly woman, busy mending some clothes. The visitor
noticed for the first time that the girl’s clothing was almost
as patched as his own. It was not so noticeable, however,
in a pretty girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old woman sat up and stared at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is this?” she asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A beggar, lady. Peace be with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman’s glance softened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come in,” she said, “and welcome to what we can give.
Sit down. Have you come far?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From across the Dark Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So far—and you are lame? Quick, Bagga, make some
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Bagga whispered something in her mother’s ear. The
latter looked at her daughter, and then at the stranger. Her
glance expressed concern.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it true? You have lost an eye, and lame as well?”
She came towards him. “Then you must be&nbsp;... you are
Guest the One-eyed?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So I am called,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>She grasped his hand, and her voice trembled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God bless you!” she said earnestly—“God bless you!
And blessed be the hour that brought you here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga had left the room, and the two were alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you spend the night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the hills.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And without shelter? How can you endure such hardships—an
old man?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am well hardened to it by now. Though, to tell the
truth, my shoulder is somewhat stiff from last night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope it may be no worse. Let me make up a bed for
you now, and you can have a good rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would rather lie in the hayloft. A bed would seem
strange to me now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Somewhat unwillingly the widow agreed to let him have
his way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you have come to Hofsfjordur after all, though after
many years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; Fate has brought me here at last, in my old age.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then Fate is kind to us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fate is always kind,” replied the old man earnestly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Even when it brings us trouble and distress?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then most of all, good soul, if you did but know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Even when it leads us into temptation—drives us to
sin?” The widow looked up at him quickly as she spoke,
and lowered her eyes again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We mortals are poor clay; God has need of strange ways
to work us to His will.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you think all that happens is decreed—a part of
God’s plan with us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In a way, yes. Each man’s actions are determined by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the nature of his soul; that makes his fate. All that men
do is a result of their own character. But the deeds that
we do most naturally are good. Therefore, we should each
be master of ourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But a sin committed can never be a good action or lead
to any good. Surely it were better that such an act had
never been?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A sin committed can bring out the good in one who is
so made that the good in him can be reached by no other
way. One can wander through many lands and yet not
escape from one evil deed. The memory of it will stay fresh
in the mind, and in time can soften the hardest heart, or make
the weakest strong; good thoughts and strength of will grow
out of it. I speak as I have found it. But perhaps you
have not found it so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman bent over her work.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she said. “You speak the truth. I, too, have
sinned, and the memory of it has made me better than I was,
or ever could have been without it. But I never thought of
it so until now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga entered with some food. She wore a bandage over
one eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, child?—have you hurt yourself?” asked the
mother anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga blushed hotly, set down the plates, and tore away
the handkerchief from her head, laughing nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>The others laughed too—it was easy to see what the girl
had been doing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I forgot to take it off,” she explained shyly. “It’s not
so very bad, after all, to have only one eye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better to have two,” said Guest the One-eyed. “More
especially if they are as blue and as good as yours.” And
he looked at her with a kindly smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga was still embarrassed; she glanced anxiously at the
visitor, and asked: “You are not angry with me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He patted her arm. “How could I be? After you have
given me leave to call you Bagga?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you go away from here, I will go with you all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>way to the next place. I am strong, and I can carry your
sack for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s kind of you. And I shall not be angry with you,
not even if you fasten a stick to one leg just to see what it
feels like to be lame!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga’s checks were burning now; she was nearly crying.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—I did just now,” she confessed. “And it was much
worse than—the other. But I’ll never do it again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed burst out laughing. Even the girl’s
mother could not help joining in. And there was not much
of anger in the rebuke she gave her daughter.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Night spread its broad, dark wings over the land.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under the shadow of night the world is changed
from what it was while day still reigned. Fear,
that the daylight holds in check, is then abroad, and the
unseen seems nearer than before. All things are changed,
save Love that is unalterable; Love that is constant whether
in light or dark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed had long since laid his tired limbs
to rest in the hay, the widow’s soul far, far away in the land
of dreams, when the outer door of the house opened slowly;
only a crack at first, through which the dog silently made
its way, followed then by the girl, who stepped with careful,
noiseless tread.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga closed the door behind her without a sound, patted
the dog, and whispered to it to be silent. And the intelligent
beast seemed to understand that this was a business that must
be kept secret between it and its mistress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Off went the pair, in the direction of the stream, the dog
hard at Bagga’s heels, and evidently interested in the night’s
adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they neared the flock of sheep, where they lay huddled
together for the night, she made the dog lie down, while she
called softly, as was her wont, for Ørlygur’s lamb. There
was a slight commotion in the flock, and the black-headed
lamb came trotting up.</p>

<p class='c004'>Offering some bread she had brought with her, Bagga
gradually enticed it away from the rest. She moved very
slowly, to avoid alarming the others, over towards the natural
bridge across the stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dog trotted along behind, with its tail down. It was
jealous of the lamb, knowing well that, when Bagga had it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>with her, any other creature must take second place. To
approach her now would mean a scolding, and the dog had
no desire to be sent back home, just when there was every
prospect of something quite unusual happening.</p>

<p class='c004'>All went well. The lamb gave no trouble, and the dog
followed at a safe distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the girl’s heart was sad; it was hard now to have to
part with the lamb she had cherished as a link between her
lover and herself—a tangible memory of the one she loved
so deeply, yet with whom she had never spoken—whom she
had only seen now and then at church on Sundays.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reaching the bridge, she took off her garter and fastened
it round the lamb’s neck, to have something to hold by in
case the animal should take fright. Then carefully she led it
across, the earth underfoot vibrating all the time with the
rush of the water below.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a time, the supply of breadcrumbs having ceased,
the lamb grew lazy, and showed signs of becoming rebellious.
It seemed to resent having been thus disturbed in the middle
of the night. As long as there had been compensation in
the way of dainty morsels to nibble, it was perhaps worth
it, but now it would prefer to lie down and chew the cud
in peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga, however, persisted, and with coaxing and scolding
urged on her little charge.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a long road, but at last they reached Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quietly as possible she opened the gate of the enclosure.
It would never do to rouse the dogs. Then she stroked
the lamb sadly in farewell, her tears falling on its woolly
fleece, and thrust it through the gate, which she closed after it.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had forgotten to take her garter from its neck.</p>

<p class='c004'>As she turned away from the gate, a feeling of loneliness
and misery overcame her; it was as if she had lost the one
treasure of her life—nothing was left but loneliness and
emptiness. Then gradually she grew more composed. The
dog marked her trouble, and fawned on her; she came to
herself, and realized that it was time to return home.</p>

<p class='c004'>She stood for a little, gazing with wet eyes at the dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>outline of the homestead; there slept her lover, never dreaming
she was near. Surely, surely in some mysterious way
he must feel that she was there, and come to her? Not to
speak to her, no—that he should ever speak seemed to her
like a thing so distant as to be almost unreal—an entering
into paradise. But come he surely must—if only that they
might see each other—that he might realize how she loved
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But she must go.... With bowed head she turned in the
direction of home. The long road was covered, she hardly
knew how, and, without once waking to conscious thought
of the way, she found herself in the house once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Silently she undressed; her head was aching, and it was
long before she could sleep. At length she fell into a heavy
slumber.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she woke next morning it seemed as if the journey
of the night had been a dream; she had to go out and convince
herself that the lamb was really gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once sure, however, she felt an indescribable joy—so near
she had been to her heart’s desire that night. And none
to know of it but God.... She could not understand now
why she had felt sad at parting with the lamb; the night
stood out now like a gleam of brightness in her life.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of her garters was missing—she could not remember
what she had done with it. Fallen off somewhere, perhaps,
and lying out on the road. It would be hopeless to try and
find it now, though, among all the rocks; she might as well
give it up for lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>But it was a pity, for it was a nice one, neatly embroidered,
and with her name worked on so prettily....</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>While Bagga was thus busy with her daydreams,
Guest the One-eyed was deep in earnest talk with
her mother, who confided to him the story of her
life—the story of her heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, and had been
married against her will, though with no great resistance on
her part, to the son of a rich landowner. The man she really
loved was a young labourer on her father’s place. No one
knew of it, and the man himself had but a vague idea; she
could not say if he returned the feeling or not. After some
six months of married life, Fate—or the well-laid plans of
her lover himself—brought him to work on her husband’s
farm. And now began a time of sore trial for her. The
young man had become aware of her inclination, and made
his advances boldly. So successfully did he play the part
of broken-hearted lover that she fell a victim to his persuasion.
So much Guest the One-eyed was able to gather from
the widow’s own confession; she did not spare herself in the
recital.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had already borne a son—her husband’s child. Immediately
after having given way to her lover, she had endeavoured
to persuade him to go with her, take her away from
the place; she could not stay with her husband as things
were. But the lover was quite content to leave all as it
was; indeed, it was evident that he preferred to have her
there. Then she saw through him, realized the true nature
of his feelings towards her, and confessed everything to her
husband. The latter had, after a violent scene, at last agreed
to forgive her, and treated her kindly. But she was determined
to leave him, and went off to live alone, making no
claim on him or on her father for her subsistence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>It was nineteen years ago now. At first, she had earned
her living where and how she could—cleaning fish or washing
wool. Then the child came, and she found it impossible
to obtain work anywhere. Finally, she had settled down at
Borg, where she had stayed three years. In spite of the
kindness with which she was treated by Ormarr and Runa,
however, she found herself regarded with suspicion. With
her small savings, and some help from Ormarr, she had
just been able to rent and stock her little holding, and had
lived there now with her daughter for nearly fourteen
years.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, life was pleasant enough, she said. And Guest the
One-eyed understood that she had grown so accustomed to
hard work and scanty fare that she would have found it
hard now to change to another mode of life. But she looked
to her daughter’s upbringing with motherly care, and her
great anxiety was the girl’s future. How would it be with
her when she went out into the world? Would she be able
to live down her mother’s past? Would God in His mercy
spare her the consequences of her mother’s sin?</p>

<p class='c004'>That it was a sin she understood now; now, for the first
time, she realized how unpardonable her act had been. The
consequences might yet be visited upon her child. And her
conscience made her suffer; she feared at times that the agony
of her remorse would drive her to madness. She was on the
edge of an abyss; only by the utmost effort could she preserve
her self-control.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed had heard many secrets; listened to
the story of many lives. And in his long years of life he
had learned to sift the facts of a case, to find out truth as
much from what was left unspoken as from what was said.
The widow’s life stood out clearly to his mind’s eye in all
its detail.</p>

<p class='c004'>They sat in silence for a while.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the girl’s father,” asked Guest at last—“is he still
living near?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” answered the widow, and her lips tightened. “He
went away across the seas soon after I left the place. Afraid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>maybe, that there might be trouble, and thought it best to
be out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again there was a pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then said Guest the One-eyed quietly, “You are troubled
at heart by the thought that the sins of the fathers are to be
visited upon the children. Do not let that weigh too heavily
upon you now. There are those who suffer so deeply for
their own sins that they atone for them in life, and more.
You are one of these. I am not speaking empty words to you
for comfort’s sake, but the truth. You can trust me. God
has granted me the power to give my fellow-men in need the
knowledge of remission of their sins, as far as may be in
knowledge of the truth. I have sinned, and my debt is not
yet paid—but my sin was greater than yours or that of any
other I have met. But the Lord God is merciful, and I
believe that He will grant me peace at last. At last, in death.
And when that comes, I can say with truth that my life,
by God’s grace, has been a happy one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman looked at him, with the same dull hopelessness
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How can you know that I have sufficiently atoned for
my sin—you, who have known me only since yesterday, and
heard no more than I have told you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed smiled, and a strange look of far-seeing
wisdom lit up his heavy face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe that the Lord has sent me to you for your comfort
in need—that the Lord has given me, and to no other, a
sign to make you sure. I am no prophet, and I do not profess
to tell what will or will not come. But—shall I tell you
a secret? Promise me, first, that you will not act in any way
to bring about that which shall come in God’s good time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman grasped his hand and nodded. Her eyes were
fixed intently on his face, as if striving to read his words ere
they were spoken.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your daughter will be the happiest woman in this land.
She is loved by the purest soul I have ever looked into through
human eyes.” He turned away for a moment, and murmured,
as if to himself: “I thank Thee, Lord, for Thy great mercy.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Then, addressing the widow again, he went on: “And she,
on her part, returns his love with all her innocent heart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman’s face darkened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible,” she said. “There is no young man she
knows here at all. I do not believe she has ever spoken to
one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remember your promise, and trust me now. The girl
is in her heart—and in the book of Fate—betrothed and
wedded to the one I speak of. Give time, and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I could believe you now....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can—you must. It is long since these lips framed
a lie—never in the life of Guest the One-eyed have they
spoken falsely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow looked at him earnestly, doubt and hope struggling
in her mind. Guest the One-eyed leaned towards her,
his face deathly pale, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“He of whom I speak—he, too, was born as the fruit of
a sin—but a sin that is, or will be soon, I trust, atoned for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman was weeping now, but they were tears of relief
rather than despair. “I cannot fathom it all,” she murmured.
“But I believe you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed smiled sadly, and cast a grateful glance
to heaven.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Later in the day, Guest the One-eyed became feverish, and
the pain in his shoulder became acute. He could not hide
the fact that he was suffering, and the widow wished him to
go to bed at once and remain there for the present. But he
obstinately refused even to stay in the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have farther yet to go,” he said, with his sad, kindly
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he was leaving, he asked suddenly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was there not once a priest here, Sera Ketill?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow looked up at him in surprise. Then she cast
down her eyes and frowned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“His name is accursed in this house,” she said—“as are
all those who have deceived under the mask of love.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>The man paled at her words. For a moment he seemed
stunned. Then, taking up his sack and staff, he limped from
the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman hurried after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you ill?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I am going now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—you have not said good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forgive me,” said Guest the One-eyed. “But you have
said that which struck me to the heart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman looked at him blankly. Then, giving up all
attempt at finding out the mystery, she asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you not leave some good word after you?—some
word to help?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed looked at her. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let your heart be open to Love and closed to Hatred;
and let your lips be quick to bless, but slow to curse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God be with you,” said the woman, her voice quivering
on the verge of tears. “God’s blessing go with you where
you may go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And, turning hurriedly to hide her shame and emotion, she
re-entered the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed limped painfully along beside the
stream. Suddenly he remembered the girl, whom he had
forgotten in the trouble of his soul, and turned to seek her.
But at that moment she came running towards him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stopped, breathless, and looked at him reproachfully.
“Would you have gone without a word to me?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had just remembered,” he said softly. “But for a moment
my soul was not my own.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She took his sack and put her arm in his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will go with you as far as I may,” she said.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>A calm, sunny day. The old man trudged along the
valley, leaning on the girl’s arm. Her golden hair
and his white locks shone like haloes round their
heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now and again a flock of ptarmigan rose at their feet.
Already the birds had shed their brown plumage and donned
their winter coats of white.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed as if summer were loth to bid farewell. The
sea was calm, and the river flowed smoothly on its way; the
lakes lay still as mirrors, reflecting the hills around and the
blue sky above. No sound was heard from the homesteads
but the occasional neigh of a horse or the barking of a dog.
Even the rocks seemed less bleak and bare than usual, lapped
as they were now in the warm rays of the sun. All seemed
intent on looking its best at the last—the last it might be, for
another day might bring cold winds and wintry gales, ushering
in snow and ice.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man and the girl had gone some distance on their
way when they came to a grassy slope that seemed inviting
them to rest and look out over the scene. Somewhat shyly,
the girl took out a packet of food and offered him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, that is your breakfast you have packed up here,”
said the old man as he opened it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not hungry,” said the girl bravely, but the effort
was plain to be seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed stroked her head and began to eat;
he succeeded, however, in persuading her to share with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>When they had finished, he asked her:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you not turn back now? It is a long way home
already.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him pleadingly. “Oh, I will run all the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>home. I am never tired—and I should like to see you within
sight of the next homestead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad to have you—but we had better go on. We
must not lose more time sitting here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He made no motion to rise, however, and for a while they
sat in silence. Then he asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you ever hear of one Sera Ketill, once priest of this
parish, many years ago?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl burst into tears, and sat crying quietly. He put
no further question, but after a little said quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I hurt you, child? I would not have done that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That—that was his father,” she answered, sobbing. “Did
you not know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I knew,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And they all say unkind things and hate him,” she went
on, still sobbing passionately. “He drowned himself because
he had been so wicked he couldn’t bear it—all the sorrow that
came after. Threw himself over the cliff, they say; he was
seen there the night after his father died in the church.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And he left a will giving all he had to the poor, but they
say it was only to make them sorry for the hard things they
had said, and pray for his soul. And they never would forgive
him, and they say the Evil One has taken him, because
the body was never found. Isn’t it cruel! And all that was
twenty years ago, and all that time no one has ever thought
kindly of him once—only me, and I couldn’t help it. His
father.... I don’t know if <em>he</em> ever thinks of him. And yet
he must, since it was his father....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gradually the girl became more composed. Her companion
sat quietly, with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly she raised her tear-stained face towards him and
asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you hate him, too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed looked her straight in the face as he
answered:</p>

<p class='c004'>“For twenty years my life has been spent in seeking God’s
mercy and forgiveness towards him.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The girl’s eyes lit with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you knew him? And were you fond of him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man was silent for a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sera Ketill is not dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, thank God for that! Is it really true?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God bless you, child, that you are glad to hear it. Yes,
it is true. He is yet a wanderer on earth, and penitent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he very far away? Shall I ever see him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not very far away. But ask no more just now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked on until a fertile valley lay before them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Close by was a small farm; other homesteads were scattered
about not far off.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man slung his sack over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall I never see you again?” asked the girl, her eyes
filling with tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You like me, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love you. Every one loves and blesses you. If I had
a father, I should wish him to be like you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—I am only a beggar.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no shame in that,” answered the girl in surprise,
“for one like you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall I bring Sera Ketill your greeting if I see him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and tell him that I pray for him always.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think you can get home now before dark?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed; I am not tired at all now. Good-bye.”
And she gave him her hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye,” he said, “and God be with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl hurried off in the direction of home, and Guest
the One-eyed turned towards the farm.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>On the morning after Bagga’s expedition with the
lamb, Ormarr was up and about before any of the
others at Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was his custom to rise early. His nights were often
restless, and it was only after he had been up and out a little
that he felt refreshed. The work drove sad thoughts from
his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was not happy, though he would have found it hard
to say what was wrong. He could not honestly declare that
he regretted having given up the path of fame that once had
stood open to him through his music.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the old days, whenever he had touched his violin, the
contrast between the harmony of music and the discord of
the world as it was had wrought on him so strongly that he
had been driven to seek solitude. His sensitive soul craved
rest, quivering as it did under the harshness of reality. It
was not the desire for appreciation of his art, but the longing
for harmony in life that he felt most deeply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here, on the farm, existence was rendered tolerable by
the fact that he had to be constantly at work; the management
of the estate gave him much to do, in addition to
which the affairs of the parish were almost wholly entrusted
to his care. And the affection and respect of his people,
which he could not but perceive, served largely to aid him in
the constant struggle within.</p>

<p class='c004'>The people loved him, not only because he helped them
in every possible way, and never refused his aid and counsel,
but also because they felt that in him they had a true leader.
They saw the firmness of character, the stern will, which he
exercised in his own life, and it gave them courage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr invariably began the day by a visit of inspection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>round the farm to see that all was in order. The animals
allowed to go loose about the place were carefully looked to
each morning to see that they had come to no harm during
the night.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the first things to catch his eye this morning was
Ørlygur’s lamb. He noticed the black head at once, and as
he approached, the animal rose up, bleating pitifully.
Evidently it was in distress about something. As soon as he
had caught it, he noticed the blue ribbon at its neck, looked
at it, and found the name “Snebiorg” woven in red letters.
He was about to take it off, but changed his mind and let
the lamb go. There were not two women of that name in
the parish. And the lamb had got into the enclosure during
the night, though the gate was fastened. Ormarr was
not quite clear in his own mind as to what had happened,
but at any rate, if the ribbon were intended for any one, it
was not for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He thought it over for a while, and then went into the
house to wake Ørlygur.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your lamb has come back. You will find it outside.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was out of bed in an instant. His father hesitated,
as if deliberating whether to say more, but after a moment’s
reflection left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur threw on his clothes and hurried out—there was
the lamb, sure enough. But—it did not recognize him.
Evidently, in the course of the summer, it had forgotten him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ribbon at its neck caught his eye at once, and he bent
down to examine it. At first sight of the name he started
in astonishment, and let go his hold. Then, catching the
animal again, he took the ribbon from its neck with trembling
fingers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lamb was let to run as it pleased; Ørlygur stood with
the garter in his hand, stroking it softly. His heart beat
fast, his head was giddy. Tears came to his eyes, and his
thought was all confused, but there was a great joy at his
heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat down on the wall of the enclosure; the sun was
just rising. Never before had he seen such a glorious opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to any day. The piece of ribbon in his hand made this day
one beyond all others; it called him from his sleep to be
king in a beautiful world.</p>

<p class='c004'>He realized now that, though he had felt sure before, there
had nevertheless been something lacking—and here it was.
All was certain now. And the joyous possibilities of the
future seemed unbounded. He sat there now for hours, deep
in his dreams, twining the ribbon round his fingers, one after
another—none must be forgotten—and at last round his neck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he started at the sight of his father approaching,
and put away the ribbon hastily. He got up in some embarrassment;
it occurred to him suddenly that Ormarr might
perhaps have noticed the ribbon himself at first. The thought
left him utterly at a loss.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr came up and sat down quietly, as if unaware of
anything typo.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A fortunate thing about the lamb,” he said. “Coming
back unharmed like that. All sorts of accidents might have
happened to it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Ørlygur, trying to speak calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you time to help me today with the mangers in
the big stable?—or were you thinking of going somewhere
else?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur felt suddenly that it was most urgent he should
go somewhere else, though he had no clear idea as to where.
There was something in Ormarr’s voice that seemed to suggest
he was not expected to remain at home.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not answer at once. Ormarr sat waiting for an
answer, but without impatience, as if realizing something of
what was passing in the young man’s mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Ørlygur spoke, it was with a calmness that surprised
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes—I was going for a walk&nbsp;... over towards Bolli.
I thought of giving the lamb—to the widow there. She
would be glad of it, no doubt; then she could kill one of her
own sheep instead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr apparently found nothing in this proposal beyond
an ordinary act of charity; he simply said:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“Yes, give it to her. Or perhaps to her daughter. Then
you may be sure it would be well looked after.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is true.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had now completely regained his composure, but
was still somewhat at a loss to understand his foster-father’s
attitude in the matter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can bring them greeting from me,” said Ormarr, as
he rose and walked away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was both glad and sorry. But he knew it was best
not to let Ørlygur’s love affairs become a matter of dissension
between them. They of Borg had need to hold together well;
he had made his sacrifice—all that remained now was to prepare
his wife.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>When Ørlygur arrived at Bolli, with the lamb trotting
contentedly behind him, he found the widow outside the
gate.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him, and then at the lamb. She had noticed
that morning that it was missing, but had merely thought
it had been found and taken away earlier in the day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning,” she said in answer to his greeting.
“Your lamb seems loth to leave us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga had told her mother before that the lamb always
came back every time she had essayed to drive it off with
other stray sheep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It seems so,” Ørlygur agreed. “Can I have a word with
Snebiorg?” There was a lump in his throat; he could hardly
speak the name.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She is not at home just now. We had a stranger here
last night, and she has gone out to see him a little on his way.
How far, I do not know. Can you guess who the stranger
was?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think so. Guest the One-eyed, was it not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh—then you knew he was here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I was the first to meet him. When I left him
yesterday he was on his way to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you not come with him, then, and fetch your
lamb? When did you fetch it?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“I did not fetch it at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—it was here last night, and this morning it was
gone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Ørlygur understood what had happened. And
he flushed at the thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That may be so,” he answered vaguely. He hardly knew
what to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow looked at him, as if somewhat offended at his
tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you come in and sit down for a while?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” said Ørlygur. And they went indoors.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had never been inside the house before. The little
room was furnished with two beds; he looked immediately
at the one which was evidently Bagga’s. Her hat hung on
a nail at the head of the bed, her knife and fork were in a
little rack close by. On a shelf lay her Bible and Prayer
Book, with some other volumes. He dared not take them
up to see what they were—they looked like collections of the
Sagas. The bed was neatly made, and a knitted coverlet
of many colours spread over.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat down on the other bed with a strange sense of being
an intruder here. His thoughts were vague, but he was
dimly conscious that the place was filled with the spirit and
life of the girl herself. Here she lived; the little trifles in
the room were things she daily touched.</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow, entering behind him, invited him to sit on the
other bed. He did so, feeling dazed, and seating himself
uncomfortably on the very edge. The widow suggested that
he need not be afraid of lying down if he were tired, but he
declined the offer with some abruptness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman sat knitting, and for a long time neither spoke,
only glancing across at each other from time to time.</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow was not altogether pleased with this visit. She
was at a loss to think what Ørlygur à Borg could have to say
to her daughter, but as he did not speak, she was not inclined
to ask him. Also, she remembered her promise to Guest the
One-eyed the day before.</p>

<p class='c004'>They sat thus all day, exchanging only an occasional word.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Once the widow went out and made some coffee, which they
drank in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length she remarked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are very patient to wait so long.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little later she brought him some food and a drink of
milk. She herself had eaten her meal in the larder, as was
her wont. While he ate, she sat with her knitting, glancing
at her guest now and again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bagga must soon be here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow pointed to the bookshelf. “You might take a
book, if you care to, and pass the time. You must be tired
of waiting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not tired of waiting,” said Ørlygur.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dusk was falling when Bagga at last returned. As soon
as her mother heard her footsteps outside, she rose and left the
room. Ørlygur remained seated. Something was about to
happen—something wonderful, incredible, beyond his control.
He was to see her—hear her voice, perhaps—even speak to
her himself. He felt unable to move. The thing must happen.
And then—what then?</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow exchanged a hasty greeting with her daughter,
and told her that one was waiting to speak with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga was overcome with confusion, a wave of warmth
swept through her body, and her hands grew moist.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Me—to speak with me—who is it, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go in and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow disappeared into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga could hardly find strength to walk the few steps
through into the room. When at length she entered and
saw Ørlygur standing there, she stood and stared at him without
a word. Ørlygur, too, was unable to speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>She offered her hand, and he took it, but the greeting was
equally awkward on both sides. At last Ørlygur plucked up
courage to speak:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you have my lamb?” he asked. “I have brought
it with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The girl smiled, but did not look up. “Thank you,” she
said simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a long time they stood facing each other without a
word, hardly daring to breathe. Ørlygur felt he had much
to say, but could find no words. At last he offered his hand
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She took it hesitatingly, but this time their clasp was one
of lingering affection. They stood breathing heavily; then
suddenly she leaned forward with her forehead against his
shoulder; her hot cheek touched his. For a moment he
pressed her to him, and passed his hand caressingly over
her hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a sigh she slipped from his arms, pressed his hand
once more, and turned away. Then quietly Ørlygur left the
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went out of the house without taking leave of the
widow. The latter, returning a little later to the room, asked
if he had gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did he come for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He gave me his lamb.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing more?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a long pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does he love you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga turned her face away. “Yes,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you love him too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl burst into tears. “Yes, mother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow took her daughter in her arms. “God’s blessing,
my child. No need to be sorry for that. By the look
of him, he is not one to change.”</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Guest the One-eyed felt both ill and tired
when, after bidding farewell to Bagga, he limped up
towards the farm.</p>

<p class='c004'>An old man, evidently the master of the place, was busy
with some men thatching a hayrick with slabs of turf. The
turf lay rolled up and set in piles about on the ground, a
couple of hundred rolls, perhaps, in all. It had been a laborious
task to cut the pieces thin and even at the edge; the
strips were about ten feet long. Two men were busy on the
stack, preparing it for the roof, the highest point carefully
set so as to give an even slope on all sides. Others were lifting
the rolls, taking great care to avoid a break. The farmer
himself did but little of the work, being chiefly occupied with
looking on and giving orders.</p>

<p class='c004'>The arrival of a stranger caused a momentary pause in the
work. Those on the ground gathered round him, and the
two men on the stack leaned over to see.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who are you?” asked the farmer curtly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A beggar,” answered the newcomer, seating himself on
one of the rolls of turf.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought as much,” grumbled the man. “Can’t you
sit on the ground, instead of spoiling my turf?” And, turning
angrily to the men, he shouted:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what is there to stare at? Get to your work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed sat down, and for a while was left
to himself. A dog came trotting up, sniffed at him, and
curled up dog-fashion at his feet, apparently satisfied of
being in decent company.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length the farmer turned to him again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, old Greybeard, what news from anywhere?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s little news I can tell.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“I daresay. All you think of is the meals you get—in
other folks’ kitchens.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s many things a man can think of. Will you give
me shelter for the night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve no beds for lazy vagabonds. But you can sleep in
the barn if you like, though I warn you it’s draughty. I
take it you can do some tricks or tell a story or something
in return?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed smiled and, looking up at him, said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you ever heard the story of the rich man and
Lazarus?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer turned pale with rage. “You cursed bundle
of rags!” he shouted. “You dare&nbsp;... I’ll have you taken
up before the sheriff for begging if you don’t mind your
words!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The men looking on smiled. The local authority was Ormarr
à Borg, and all knew there would be little gained by
an angry man who came to him demanding the punishment
of some poor wanderer for begging. It would, indeed, be
about the best thing that could happen to the culprit himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is your name?” demanded the farmer, striding
towards him with a threatening mien.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am called Guest the One-eyed,” answered the old man,
with his quiet smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer was taken aback. “Guest the One-eyed! Impossible.
He never comes this way. Guest the One-eyed....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at the beggar again, shifted his feet, and stood
in some confusion. “God’s blessing,” he stammered out at
last. “Forgive me—I did not know. Come—come up to
the house with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And clumsily he helped the wanderer to rise; his hands
were little used to helping others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me take your sack,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nay—a beggar carries his own,” answered Guest the
One-eyed, and hoisted it on his back. Then suddenly he
smiled and, swinging down the sack once more, handed it
to the farmer, who took it as if it were a favour granted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed glanced at him mischievously.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“’Tis strange to see you with a beggar’s pouch. None
would have thought you could ever come to that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer cast a sidelong glance at his men, and was
about to make an angry retort, but restrained himself and
gave a forced laugh. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I were to fill the sack with more than you could carry—what
then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I should let it lie.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer was evidently anxious to make much of his
visitor; the latter, however, seemed to care little for his
hospitality, and would not even accept the bed that was
offered him. The farmer assured him that it was a bed reserved
for personages of distinction; bishops and high officials
had lain in it. But Guest the One-eyed preferred to sleep
in the barn, and all that the farmer could do was to have
the cracks in the walls stopped as far as possible, and a fresh
layer of hay laid over the rotting stuff that strewed the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before retiring, the beggar brought up the subject of Sera
Ketill.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That scoundrel!” cried the farmer angrily. “Ay, a
scoundrel he was.” And a murmur from those around
showed that he had voiced the general feeling. “He duped
them all. Not a man but was on his side. I remember him,
and his lying sermons and his talk—and I was no wiser than
the rest, to doubt my old friend. Ørlygur à Borg, he was a
true man, and Sera Ketill that killed him—his own father....
I shan’t forget! And his poor wife, the Danish Lady
at Hof—ruined for life. Twenty years now she’s lived at
Borg, and never got back to sense nor wit. ’Tis a comfort
to think he’ll suffer for it all, or there’s no justice in heaven.
The Devil must have marked him from the first—and took
and kept him, and best he should. If I met Sera Ketill at
the gates of Paradise, I’d turn and go another way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And the farmer laughed, pleased with his own wit and
confident of his own salvation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed had listened with pale face to the outburst
of hatred and scorn. At last he rose heavily to his feet
and said:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“It is time a weary man went to his rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer went with him to the barn.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you will sleep here,” he said. “Though why you
should, with a fine bed waiting, I can’t see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis best to seek a place that’s not above one’s deserts,”
said the other mildly. And he added, “Though, for some,
it may be hard to find.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Left to himself, the wanderer lay staring into the darkness.
And his lips moved in an inaudible prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My God, my God—if only I might dare to hope for forgiveness
at the last; only one gleam of Thy mercy to lighten
my heart. I am weighed down with the burden of my sin,
and long has been my penance, but what is all against the
evil I have done? Yet I thank Thee, Lord, that I alone am
let to suffer; that Thy wrath has not been visited on that
innocent child.”</p>

<p class='c004'>During the night his fever increased. He could not sleep,
and lay tossing uneasily from side to side, murmuring often
to himself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord, I feel now that Death is near. Good that it comes
at last, and yet I fear it. What will Death mean for me?
Some hell more terrible than I have lived through all these
years? Thy will be done! It will not be tonight, I think.
Another day, and then&nbsp;... Death.... Lord, Thy will be
done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He lapsed into a state of drowsy helplessness, murmuring
still to himself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord, Lord&nbsp;... two children were granted me of Thy
grace. And to the one was given Thy peace in death; the
other has found happiness in life.... I thank Thee,
Lord....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He lay bathed in perspiration; dust and fragments of hay
clung to his face and hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two Women&nbsp;... Lord, forgive me.... Mercy,
Lord....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He flung himself over on his side and hid his face.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“Father, how often have I sinned against Thee! And
knowing my sin, yet hardening my heart. Even then I suffered,
but I would not heed, and persevered in sin. Forgive
me, Lord.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while he lay still, then turned again. He strove to
raise himself, but his strength failed him, and, sinking back,
he cried aloud:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forgive me, Lord—forgive me, Lord....”</p>

<p class='c004'>His words were lost in the darkness, and he lapsed into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>He woke some hours later, exhausted and parched with
thirst. But he could not rise to seek for water, and at length
he sank into a restless, feverish sleep.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Early next morning he was awakened by the entry of the
farmer. At first he hardly realized where he was. He was
ill, with a racking pain in his head. But he strove to appear
as if nothing were amiss.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning,” said the farmer. “And how do you
feel today? Was it very draughty up here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning. I have slept well, and I thank you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer laughed at sight of his visitor’s face, which
was plastered with scraps of hay. “You’ve enough hay about
you to feed a sheep through the winter,” he said with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed had risen. As he stepped out into the
cold morning air, his teeth chattered audibly. “The sun
is not up yet, it seems,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c004'>Never before had he so longed for the rising of the sun.
He stood now staring towards the east; it seemed to him a
miracle that he should be suffered to see the sun rise once
more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The blessed sun,” he murmured to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sky showed a dull blue between hurrying banks of
cloud. The farmer yawned, and observed carelessly, “It’s
cold in the mornings now. Come in; there will be coffee
ready soon.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Guest the One-eyed went into the cowshed, washed himself
at the drinking-trough, and dried his face and hands on his
coat, the farmer watching him the while.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re one for cleanliness, I see,” he said. “I never
trouble to wash myself, these cold mornings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wanderer produced a piece of comb, and tidied his hair
and beard; it was a matter of some difficulty to get rid of the
scraps of hay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not stay here for the day and have a good rest?”
suggested the farmer. And with a sly glance he added: “I
daresay we can afford to give you a bite of food.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thank you. But I must go on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ay, there’s always haste with those that have nothing to
do,” said the farmer, with a touch of malice.</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked down a little way with his guest, some of the
farm hands accompanying them. The wanderer bade farewell
to each in turn, and all answered with a blessing. Then
they turned back, the farmer alone going on a few steps more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you not some good word to leave with me?” he
asked a little awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed looked at the man from head to foot;
the burly fellow stood as timidly before him as a child that
had done wrong.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It would be well if you were oftener to take the beggar’s
bag upon your shoulders,” he said. And, having shaken
hands in parting, he walked away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God be with you,” said the farmer, and stood for some
moments watching the beggar as he limped along. For the
first time in his life he began to feel that perhaps after all
wealth and security were not the only things worth coveting.
There were other things—other feelings than the sense of
material gain or loss.</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked back to the house somewhat humbled in mind,
and, going into his room, sat down on the bed with his head
bowed in his hands. For long hours he sat there, seemingly
in thought. In the evening, he roused himself with a sigh,
and went out to where the men were working. His tone
seemed harsher than his wont as he ordered them about.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>But Guest the One-eyed went on his way, shivering and
muttering to himself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Haste—yes, for today. But tomorrow? Who knows?
Who asks? What do we know of it all? Life&nbsp;... and
mortals playing at joy and sorrow; a little life&nbsp;... a long
life&nbsp;... playing at life&nbsp;... playing with others’ hearts and
with our own. And thinking it all in earnest. And the
end? The grave, the grave. Cold earth, dark earth, where
the sun cannot reach, though its grace be spread all above.
My God, my God, what are my thoughts? Not earnest? Is
it not earnest, all our life? Lord, forgive me. Thoughts,
thoughts that come and go—but not for long. Thoughts fearing
to end, to die under the earth, and never reach to heaven.
My soul—Lord God, where is my soul? Is there a soul that
is mine? Lord, Lord, forgive me! This is the last day Thy
grace allows me; the last day of life on earth, of life and the
blessing of the sun for me; the last day granted me to feel
joy in the light. Joy? But my days have been pain, pain.
And yet there is joy.... The last day&nbsp;... Lord, here am
I, Thy servant. Let Thy wrath be turned away from me, O
Lord, and see my heart that repents, repents. Forgive me,
Lord....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He crouched down beside a rock, and laid his head upon
the stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God in heaven, I can feel Thy presence. Or is it that
God is far away? Is it mercy or God’s judgment that comes?
Forgive me, Lord, if there can be forgiveness.... Thy will
be done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rose, and limped along his painful way.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Guest the One-eyed wandered far that day.
He felt that it was fated to be his last.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fever burned in his veins; fever in his soul. It
seemed a painful task to end this life. And he was tormented
by dread lest his sufferings should after all not suffice to
atone for his sin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sun and rain and hail took turns to follow him on this
the hardest of all his wandering days. Clouds and sheets of
hail passed before the face of the sun, making strange shadows
on the hillsides, the contrast being more pronounced
where dark stretches of lava and the lighter hue of cornfields
alternated. One moment the sun’s rays warmed him,
the next he was stung by the sudden lash of hailstones in
his face. It was a day of contest between the powers of sun
and shadow—a giant’s battle where summer and life were
pitted against autumn and death. And the earth over which
it raged was marked by each in turn.</p>

<p class='c004'>His beggar’s staff changed constantly from a dry, gleaming
white to a dripping grey. He swung it at each step, as
it were a distorted extra limb. And the figure of the man
standing against the changing background of the sky seemed
hardly human; more like some fantastic creation of Nature
herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this man’s soul, maybe, was rugged and misshapen
as his body. But the soul of a man is not so easy to see....</p>

<p class='c004'>The first homestead he came to on this day’s march was
a little place. A peasant and his wife came out to meet
the stranger, the rest of their people following. They were
at home today, by reason of the weather, and had, moreover,
expected his arrival. All the district knew by now
that Guest the One-eyed had come amongst them. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>peasant and his household received him kindly, with many
blessings. He felt their kindness without any need of words,
and marked how they were glad to have him with them.</p>

<p class='c004'>And talking with them, he spoke the name of Sera Ketill,
once their priest, whom all remembered now with execration.
Here, too, the tongues that had been ready with blessing for
himself were quick to curse at the mention of that name;
to their minds, Sera Ketill was a monster, a thing of dread.
His very name made them shudder as if at the touch of
some loathsome thing. He was a murderer, a hypocrite,
and a cheat; they could not find in him the slightest link
of charity and affection with his fellow-men. Even his
death had been the act of a despicable creature, in that he
had endeavoured to secure their regard by leaving all he had
to the poor, and then flinging himself over the cliffs into
the sea. This last was not even a fine thought of his own—a
young poet had been the first to go that way, and by that
very spot.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Devil had taken his body, and his soul, if any
shred of soul he had, had doubtless gone with it. A thing
of no use upon earth! He had not even had the courage
to face the consequences of his acts. He was a stain upon
mankind; in justice, he should have been burned at the stake
before his soul went on its way to hell.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed listened pale as death to the bitter
words. Strange, how a man’s character could thus outlive
him in the memory of his fellows. Twenty years had not
sufficed to bring oblivion for the wrongs this man had done.
His body might have been reduced to ashes in a moment,
but the fire of hate burned still about his memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wanderer looked at the faces of those about him—faces
that one moment shone with kindly pleasure and the
next glowed fiercely with hate. He could not but smile,
though his heart was heavy. Poor mortals, poor unseeing
men, seeing good and evil as things absolute, unalterable.</p>

<p class='c004'>But while his thoughts were busy, his soul cried all the
time to God, praying forgiveness....</p>

<p class='c004'>Thoughts within thoughts, and thoughts again.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>For they were right, after all, these men. They themselves
had the power of being good or evil, of loving or
hating without reserve.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was their hatred he was feeling now, fuel added to the
furnace of his own remorse; he was passing through a purgatory
of maledictions.</p>

<p class='c004'>One moment he saw himself as Guest the One-eyed, beggar
and wanderer—a figure clear enough. Then he was
the doomed soul on the verge of death, doubting everything,
doubting even his own doubt, torn asunder to his innermost
being, a living cry of anguish seeking Heaven. And
then, too, he was the penitent, believing and trusting in
God—yet even so unable to wrench himself free from the
spectres of doubt and mockery and scorn that clung to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Something prompted him to rise and speak to these his
fellows gathered round him. There were many now; for
folk had come from places near to see the man of whom they
had heard so much. Yes, let them see him and judge him
by what he had been and what he was now, and act as they
were prompted to do. It was not enough that they received
Guest the One-eyed with blessings, and cursed the name of
Sera Ketill; he longed to bring both before them as one.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the impulse reached no further than his thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they cursed the man that he had been, he sat silent,
with eyes cast down. He made no movement, only sighed.
Then at last he rose, and stood a moment trying to collect
his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must go,” he said. “I have a long way before me today.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he bade farewell to each in turn, confused thoughts
passing through his mind the while.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They give me their hands—but I am stealing what they
give. If they knew me, they would spit on me. Stone me,
perhaps. Would they, I wonder—would they do so now?
But I steal what they give because I need it; it is because
I must. Soon my hand will be cold, and then my soul will
have no link with any other soul—no way to feel their love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and innocent kindness. Yes, I must let them give me their
hands—as many as I can. And after that, the grave. Lord,
remember that this is my last day&nbsp;... the very last. But
I will be patient&nbsp;... Lord, Thy will be done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he went on his way, with blessings from all. The
people stood silently watching him as he went; their hearts
had been moved beyond their daily wont by the sight of
this unhappy wanderer, and their thoughts followed him now
in sympathy along his sorrowful way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wanderer’s heart was suffering more than all. His
soul ached with loneliness—he felt as if already he were confined
within the cold walls of the grave. It seemed a marvel
to him that he could endure this and live.</p>

<p class='c004'>On and on he went, thinking—thinking....</p>

<p class='c004'>“If no man can forgive me, if no human heart can
realize my atonement, can then God ever forgive? The
blessings they have given me—can they ever outweigh the
curses that were meant for me as well? Lord, if only one
might cross my path to know me, and forgive. One who
could take my hand and know and pardon all.... Lord,
Thy will be done....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was taking the road towards the trading station. On
the way he entered a house here and there, and was greeted
kindly as ever. But at the mention of Sera Ketill’s name,
all who heard it had but curses; eyes that had looked on him
in kindliness lit now with hatred of the man he named.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have done more evil even than I thought,” he muttered
to himself as he went on his way, refusing those who
would have shared the road. “To have planted so much
hatred in all their hearts; to be the cause of all those
evil thoughts beyond my own; things grown in the dark
from evil seed of my sowing. Lord, who shall ever tear
them up and destroy them that they may not rise again?
Lord, can it be that the fruits of sin never cease, when good
comes to an end at last? Lord, Lord, now I see the greatness
of my sin—more than I had dreamed. And now I am
come to the verge of death and have no strength even to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>suffer more. Only Thy mercy, Lord—grant me Thy mercy,
that hast denied me the forgiveness of men.”</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>The trading station had grown considerably in the twenty
years that had passed. There were many new houses in the
place. And the wanderer looked in vain for the turf huts
that had formed the outskirts of the settlement when he knew
it. They were gone, and modern buildings stood where they
had been.</p>

<p class='c004'>He limped from door to door, bearing with him each time
blessings for Guest the One-eyed and curses for the name
of Sera Ketill. At the last house, he asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where do the poor live now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was still a glimmer of hope in his heart that there,
among the poorest, he might find one single heart to bless
Ketill the priest for what he had given.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are no poor here now,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are all in Hofsfjordur grown rich?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a poor widow living out at Bolli, a lonely place
at the foot of the hills. But ’tis her own fault that she
lives as poorly as she does. She might have taken the help
that was offered her. But it was the Devil Priest’s money,
and she would not take it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Devil Priest?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sera Ketill was his name. But we call him the Devil
Priest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-bye,” said Guest the One-eyed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Peace go with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On his way out from the trading station, he passed by a
shed from which came the sound of voices within. The door
stood half-open, and, looking in, he saw in the half-dark
four strange figures—three men and a woman, ragged and
wild-looking; evidently these were vagabonds like himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman was shouting a ribald song; one of the men
sat crouched on the floor rocking with laughter. The other
two men were fighting, the stronger chuckling at each successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>blow, while the other fought in silence, waiting his
chance.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man on the floor called out to the others with an oath
to come and listen. “Give over, you fools, and come and
hear. ’Tis a new song—one of Gudda’s best. Ay, Gudda,
she can make a song, if she’s not as young as she used to
be....” And he came shambling over towards them.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was a tall fellow, bigger than either of his two companions,
still young, with reddish-yellow hair and a pasty
face. The two sprang away as he came up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mind your own business, Luse-Grimur!” cried the one
nearest. This was a dark man of slender build, known as
the Bishop, from a way he had of mimicking the tones of
a priest, and repeating fragments of an indecent parody of
the marriage service whenever a couple came together.
“Keep away, and don’t bring your lice near me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have my hands nearer than you care for in a
minute,” answered Grimur, with a leer. “Go on, Gudda.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gudda was known for her talent in making songs. She
was a powerfully built woman getting on in years, with a
coarse voice in keeping with her coarse face and heavy build.
Her skirt reached hardly below her knees, showing a pair
of muscular legs; her stockings were of rough material, and
clumsily darned. One redeeming feature she had—her large
blue eyes. Children feared her until she looked them full
in the face, when the glance of her eyes seemed to draw them
to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was one of the few women vagabonds in the country,
and was known far and wide for her vulgar songs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking towards the door, she caught sight of the stranger,
and called to him to come in. Guest the One-eyed limped
over to the group.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God’s peace,” he said as he entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God’s peace with you,” returned the others, somewhat
abashed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the youngest of the party stepped forward. This
was Jon Gislason, a short, thick-set fellow who had some claim
to good repute, being known to work at times, and trusted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>to carry letters and parcels from place to place. He strode
up to the newcomer, and looked him in the face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s one of our sort,” he said. “It is Guest the One-eyed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a shout of welcome at this, and Grimur took
out a flask from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Best corn brandy,” he declared, handing the bottle to
Guest. “Good stuff, you can take my word for it.” Then,
in a slightly altered tone, he went on: “I daresay, now, you
think us rather a rough lot, you being more gentle like. But
it’s just our way. Rap out an oath without thinking
like.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Tis not such words that do the worst of harm,” said
Guest the One-eyed. And he took a sip from the flask.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then with a grimace he spat it out. “I thought it might
do me good,” he said. “But I can’t swallow it, all the
same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you swine!” shouted Grimur as he saw the precious
liquid wasted. “There, I’m sorry,” he went on. “That’s
no way to speak to a godly man. But the stuff’s too good
to waste. Leastways, to my thinking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed offered his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No harm, brother,” he said. “Each to his own ways.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Brother,’” repeated Grimur thickly. “Calls me brother—shakes
hands. Nobody ever called me brother before. My
own folk won’t touch me, call me Luse-Grimur, and keep far
out of reach of vermin. Ay, it’s true enough what they say
of you, Guest One-eyed. God’s blessing, man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have Grimur drowning his lice in floods of tears,”
grumbled the Bishop. “See them swimming around and
saying their prayers, Amen!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You, Bishop,” said Grimur warningly—“well for you
this good man’s here. If it weren’t for him, I’d send you
swimming and saying your prayers in earnest for less than
you’ve said.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Filthy beast,” said Gudda scornfully, and spat at the
Bishop, who only laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed turned to him with a keen glance.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“Have you ever thought,” he said quietly, “that one day
must be your last—that your tongue may be silent for ever
after any word you have spoken?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ho, yes. And I’ve got it all ready what I’m going to
say. When I get to the Gates of Heaven—if the Devil hasn’t
pinched my soul all hot on the way—I’ll say to the Lord:
‘Here you are; Behold the Son of Man!’ That’s my words.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You also are my brother,” said Guest the One-eyed. And
he held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Bishop spat in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed stood silent gazing at his extended
hand. Then he sat down and sobbed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Bishop’s laugh of derision died away. He stood for
a moment breathing heavily, then slunk out of the shed and
went away.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other three stood silently watching, afraid to look
at each other, uncertain what to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a little Guest the One-eyed regained his self-control,
and, looking up at them, he said quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Friends, do not hate him; believe that he is not worse
than others. Only, the way to his heart is longer and harder
to find.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have far to go,” he said, after a pause. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God’s blessing,” murmured the others as he left.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood for a moment outside the shed, uncertain which
way to turn. He would have liked to go to Hof, to the
vicarage on the other side of the fjord, but it was too far
to walk. This was his last day, and already a good part
of it was gone, though he had lost no time.</p>

<p class='c004'>He hobbled down to the beach to see if there might chance
to be a boat going across. Just as he neared the slope, he
perceived a little group of people gathered round something
he could not see. Close by, a small rowing-boat was drawn
up on the sand. Going closer, he saw a man bending over a
heap of clothes. Presently the man rose up, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Those near bared their heads and made the sign of the
cross.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Guest the One-eyed needed but a glance at the ragged heap
to recognize it—it was the body of the Bishop.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And only a moment since I was with him,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were too late,” said a fisherman. “Saw him throw
himself into the sea, and hurried after. But he held on to
some weed down below—look, there’s some of it in his hand
still.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And, true enough, the dead hand clutched a tangle of weed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So he is gone already to stand before the Lord,” he
murmured. “Poor soul—God grant him peace.” And he
made the sign of the cross above the body.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men were running the boat out. He went up to them
and asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are there many going across?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only myself,” answered a young man. “I am working
at the vicarage, and going back there now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you take me with you to the other side of the fjord?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gladly,” answered the young man, and flushed with
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c004'>The day was fine now, but clouds were racing across the
sky. Rain and hail had ceased, only the shadows of the
clouds darkened the water as they passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed sat still, gazing around him as the boat
shot out into the fjord. His eyes took in the landscape;
there, nestling in the valley, lay the homestead of Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sight of it moved him; this was the place that had
been his home. Strange to think of it now. There his infant
limbs had learned to walk, and thither he turned now, for
the last steps on his road of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was roused from his meditations by the youth, who
nodded over towards a steep cliff rising from the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was where Sera Ketill killed himself,” he said.
“You’ve heard of Sera Ketill?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I knew him. Better, perhaps, than many did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A monster of wickedness he must have been,” said the
young man, as if inviting the other to tell what he knew.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the moment, Guest the One-eyed was dull to the pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>which condemnation of Sera Ketill usually caused him. He
was about to answer absently, “Judge not&nbsp;...” but checked
himself and sat gazing vacantly across the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never thought to sail on the sea again,” he said, as if
to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Again?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. I have sailed far in my time, and seen many lands.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young man seemed to take this as a jest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean in thought, I take it?” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed looked at him. “You are not without
sense,” he remarked. “Do you travel in thought yourself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young man laughed, and shook his head. “Not much.
But I am going to America this winter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do not do that,” said the other quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not? There is good money to be made there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True. But it is easiest to die in the place where one was
born.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have not thought of dying just yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe not. But life leads only to death. Death is
the only thing we can be certain of gaining; perhaps the
only gain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had heard that Guest the One-eyed preached the Gospel
of Life,” said the young man seriously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you are disappointed to find that Guest the One-eyed
is only human after all?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young man did not reply, and they went on in silence.
They were more than half-way across the fjord by now.
Guest the One-eyed sat thinking of the strange currents beneath
the smooth surface, and the marvels of life in the
hidden depths. All seemed incomprehensible; the sea, the
life of man—they were much alike. Human existence was
merciless, restless, as the restless tossing of the waves.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a relief to step out of the boat and tread good earth
again; for a moment his mission was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the sight of the churchyard brought it once more to
his mind. He passed through the gateway. The church was
new—a more imposing edifice than the old one. Bright in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>colour, and clean and pleasant in appearance—as he looked,
memories of the old, dark, forbidding little place rose to
his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the entrance door the old stone steps remained. He
knelt down upon them, and pressed his forehead against
the stone. Then he rose, and went to the burial-place of
Borg. He found the stone he was seeking, and laid himself
down beside it in silent prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'>When at last he rose, he was so weak that he could hardly
drag himself along. He would not enter the vicarage, however,
though he needed rest and food. Passing on, he took
a narrow, unfrequented path down towards the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man who had rowed him over had at once told the
household that Guest the One-eyed was come, and had gone
into the churchyard. Soon, as he did not appear, they went
out to look for him, searching in every corner where a man
might be. But Guest the One-eyed was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Keeping to the side track for some time, Guest the
One-eyed made his way down from the vicarage
lands unobserved, but soon turned off across the
hills towards the main road. Step by step he dragged himself
towards his home, shivering in fever, weary and exhausted,
leaving the rest to God.</p>

<p class='c004'>The journey must be made; this road he must travel to
the end, no matter what greeting he might find. Curses
only, it might be; a death without a single kindly word. But
his way to death lay through Borg—and he was nearing the
end of it now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Home to Borg! home to Borg! home to Borg! The words
beat in his blood like a promise of release, his heart sobbed
with joy, and a new hope filled him, driving all doubt away.
Peace and forgiveness were near.</p>

<p class='c004'>Home to Borg! home to Borg! home to Borg! All was
brighter now; a childlike happiness came over him. He had
sinned and fled, fearing his punishment; now he was returning
home to be forgiven.</p>

<p class='c004'>He made such speed as he could, despite his waning
strength. Homeward! homeward!</p>

<p class='c004'>Rain and hail began to fall once more, but he did not
heed. His mind was full of the thought that he was nearing
a kindly end, a peaceful passing into eternal rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Home to Borg! home to Borg! home to Borg!</p>

<p class='c004'>His feet stepped in time to the ring of the words, that
sounded like sweetest music in the ears of the wearied pilgrim.
Never before had there been such a welcome message for
any on earth. Only a bruised and tortured soul could feel
the joy of it: home to Borg! home to Borg!</p>

<p class='c004'>Great is the glory of the sun that brings delight, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>spring that fills the world with sweetness, but nothing to the
wonder of returning home after years of struggle, years of
suffering in body and soul, to die among those one loves,
those who will forgive.</p>

<p class='c004'>Home to Borg! home to Borg! home to Borg!</p>

<p class='c004'>... Only the stream to cross now&nbsp;... only the little
slope to climb&nbsp;... only a few steps more....</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The household at Borg were all within doors. There
was no working outside on such a day. The sheep
had to be looked to now and again. During the
storms they took shelter where they could, but these once
past, they scattered about to graze once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had set his men to work repairing stables and cowsheds,
taking a part himself in what had to be done. But
there was no such pressing haste; the hands went to their
work with gossiping and laughter, telling stories of all sorts,
from gruesome ghost-tales to amusing anecdotes from near
and far. There was hardly work enough for all. And the
wild weather out of doors made it more cheerful to be within.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and Ørlygur took no part in the general gaiety.
It was not their way to be gloomy, but no one seemed to
notice that today they kept, as it were, somewhat aloof.
The masters might well have something that occupied their
minds, for the moment, as might any one else. And no one
thought anything of their silence, least of all attempting to
intrude on their reserve.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a matter of fact, neither Ormarr nor Ørlygur was in
the slightest degree depressed, but each had that in his mind
which claimed his attention beyond all else.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur could not forget his visit to Bolli the day before.
Time and again the various impressions of what had passed
recurred to his mind—how he had sat waiting, how clean
and tidy everything had been in the place. And the girl—every
single movement of hers was fixed in his memory,
even to the ever-restless little finger of her left hand. He
repeated over and over again the words he had heard her
speak; even the intonation was still fresh in his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>So deeply was he occupied with these recollections that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>found little thought for Guest the One-eyed, and yet he
longed to see the old man again. He felt an ever-increasing
desire to talk with him, and, in particular, to learn from a
reliable source whether his father had really been so evil
a man as was generally declared to be the case. Possibly
Guest the One-eyed might be able to recount something at
least to the credit of the former priest. Had there been anything
good in him, Guest the One-eyed would surely have
found it. And Ørlygur earnestly hoped that his father might
prove to have been not altogether bad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was thinking of a dream he had had the night before.
It was hardly any connected dream, only a sudden
vision that had come while he slept. He had seen his father
and Sera Ketill standing hand in hand at the foot of his bed.
That was all. But Ormarr could not get the vision out of his
mind, and was superstitious enough to attach some importance
to it. The more he thought of it, the more he felt sure it
must mean something—what, he could not say.</p>

<p class='c004'>Was it that his father had wished to declare to him that
he had forgiven Ketill, and no longer desired any feeling
of enmity to exist between the brothers? It seemed the most
reasonable explanation.</p>

<p class='c004'>But how could his father ever expect him to forgive Ketill,
after he had witnessed the terrible scene in the church, and
all it had cost? Not only the life it had taken; there was
also the tragedy of the poor woman who had dragged through
twenty years of life a mental wreck. Ormarr had seen his
brother denounce their father from the pulpit for the sin he,
Ketill, had committed; the consequences of that sin had been
left to Ormarr to mitigate as far as he could.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr himself had only known his brother as a boy. All
the time he had been abroad they had never met, until the
time when Ketill appeared in Copenhagen about to enter on
his priesthood. And on that occasion, despite the claims of
relationship, Ormarr had found it impossible to feel any real
liking for him. Now, knowing as he did that even at that
time the avowed servant of God had a sin upon his conscience
of which he showed no sign, it was impossible to feel any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>regard for him. Since then they had had no intercourse with
each other, and it had never occurred to Ormarr that Ketill
could ever feel himself unfairly treated in the apportionment
either of material inheritance or of affection. Ormarr had
never sought to probe the workings of his brother’s mind,
and had no idea of the way he schemed and wrought in
secret. He had seen only the outward effect of action, knowing
nothing of the inner cause, and all that he had seen had
been evil. So evil, indeed, had Sera Ketill’s actions been
that they seemed to justify the name that had been given
him—the Devil’s Priest.</p>

<p class='c004'>No. He searched his mind and heart, but could not find
a single spark of kindly feeling towards his brother, much
less affection. No matter how hard he tried to be impartial,
he was forced to admit that the expression even of any other
feeling than that of hatred would be falsehood. It was easy
to say, “Forgive the dead,” but—he still hated his brother
and loathed his memory. The man was dead, and had already
heard his judgment pronounced. Ormarr himself
might die, but he felt that even on the point of death he could
not feel otherwise than he did now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill had been evil all through; no act had been so mean
but he could stoop to it, no redeeming feature could be found
in all his doings. He had violated all the laws of love and
kinship, and trampled all that was sacred underfoot. Lying
and fraud had been his chosen weapons, and his methods
were as foul as his soul. Forgive him? No—it was all beyond
forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c004'>To forgive him would be almost like becoming himself an
accomplice in his brother’s evil deeds; his soul would be tarnished
by the mere toleration of such a memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Devil’s Priest had been his brother, blood of his
parents’ blood; it did not help him. It was impossible to
forgive. It seemed natural and inevitable as the breath
of life to curse him, hate him, and condemn him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even his death had been that of a coward—a fitting end.
And the last attempt to win the hearts of the people after
death by leaving his fortune to the poor—that, too, was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>meanness entirely in keeping with the rest. It had gained
him nothing, after all, for the poor accepted his gifts, but
reserved the right to curse him, all the same.</p>

<p class='c004'>No—even though his father took Ketill by the hand, and
led him forward to ask his brother’s pardon, though the vision
were to come a hundred times, night after night for the rest
of his life—he could not forgive him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus Ormarr thought, and his heart grew ever harder
towards his brother. Later in the day, passing by Alma’s
window, he saw her sitting there, with eyes staring emptily
out into space. And his indignation rose anew; he muttered
between his teeth a curse on the name of the Devil’s Priest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The household were sitting down to the evening meal when
Guest the One-eyed came crawling on hands and knees up
the slope towards the house. Ørlygur, seeking solitude for
the enjoyment of his thoughts and dreams, was the only
one out of doors; he at once noticed the approaching figure,
and hurried towards him, heartily glad at the meeting. He
no longer felt awkward or shy, but promptly seized the
beggar’s sack to carry up to the house himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad you have come,” he said, shaking hands
warmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man stood up with difficulty; his legs were tottering
under him. He looked earnestly at the young man with
his solitary eye, evidently noting with satisfaction the unfeigned
pleasure in his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>His brain throbbed still to the words: Home to Borg!
home to Borg! And he returned the young man’s greeting
in a voice hardly audible.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had come home—and his son was glad to see him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly he realized that his son did not know him,
and the thought dashed his gladness to the ground in a
violent reaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur took him by the arm, and led him through to the
courtyard. They had nearly reached the house when Alma
came out, leaning on old Kata’s arm. Kata had seen him
coming, and had brought her mistress out to meet him.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>At sight of the two women, Guest the One-eyed all but
fell. With an effort, Ørlygur led him to the big slab of stone
that stood in the middle of the courtyard and could be used
as a seat. The old man sank down on it, covering his face
with his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur, alarmed at the old man’s evident illness, hurried
into the house to call his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>Kata was in high spirits, and talked volubly to her mistress.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I knew he would come; it was to be. Not a doubt of
it but God has brought him here, at the end of his wanderings.
Truly God is Almighty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the beggar sat on his stone, sobbing and murmuring
brokenly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“My God! my God!—this is my doing; I have put out
the light of her soul. Those empty eyes! O God, a dreadful
thing! And Thou hast willed it so, that I should see and
understand there could be no forgiveness, for all my prayers
no mercy.... Lord, Thy will be done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two women came up to him; he raised his head and
looked at them, with fear in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Danish Lady came nearer, and stroked his hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>But old Kata took his hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Welcome now! God has forgiven you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man sat still, with a face of despair, the tears pouring
down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God can never forgive me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He can,” said old Kata earnestly. “God can forgive
all sins of all mankind. And you have borne His punishment
with patience.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have borne His punishment, yes. And now there is
only death.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The old woman’s wrinkled face lit with a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be glad of that,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guest the One-eyed sat drinking in the peace that flowed
to him through the gentle touch of Alma’s fingers as they
stroked his hair. Old Kata watched him, and understood.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See,” she said, “she does not know—and yet she knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>enough. That is her way with all who she feels are good
at heart and suffering. No other would she touch. And
never has she come to any with such tenderness as now.
Heaven bless her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Heaven bless her,” repeated the broken man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just at that moment Ormarr came out from the house,
Ørlygur close behind him. The boy had whispered to his
father that Guest the One-eyed had come, and was evidently
ill. Ormarr had risen immediately and came striding out
now with a friendly smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>The beggar rose to his feet, looked him in the face, and
bowed his head. Ormarr stood rooted to the spot, and
deathly pale. This old man, this wandering beggar, was his
brother, the one-time priest—the Devil’s Priest. And in a
moment all the stories he had heard of him passed through
Ormarr’s mind—his wisdom, his unselfishness, his generosity
and self-sacrifice. Ormarr saw the depth of his misery, how
deeply he was crushed and humbled, body and soul. And
he had seen Alma caressing him, thus placing him at once
among the “good.” And this living witness to Life’s vengeance
upon sin, with its merciless humiliation, wiped away
all hatred from his heart. But a moment ago he had hated
his brother; now all was changed. Ormarr sought down into
the depths of his heart to see if any vestige of hate remained,
but found none; all unkindliness was gone, and only pity and
sympathy remained—yes, and love. Once more the vision
of the night before rose to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Swiftly he stepped towards the pitiful figure and raised
him up; the two stood sobbing in each other’s arms. Two
sufferers under the heavy yoke of life; two creatures with
whom life had played its pitiless game of love and hate; two
brothers in strife and sorrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>And when they had stood thus awhile, Ormarr kissed his
brother and stroked his cheek, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Welcome home, brother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And Ketill answered: “God bless you, Ormarr. I have
come from our father’s grave, and I felt in my heart that
you would forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Ørlygur had been watching the scene with deep emotion.
At first he saw in it nothing but an unusually hearty welcome
on the part of Ormarr towards a wandering beggar. But
gradually it became clear to him that it was more than this,
and as their words revealed the truth, he stood half wondering
if it could be real.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Ormarr turned to him and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ørlygur, it is your father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment the young man stood still, his face twitching
in the effort to control his feelings. Then he gave up
and, sobbing openly, embraced the old man in his turn.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here was a new joy, a thing undreamed of. From childhood
he had believed his father dead, and in death remembered
only with execration by all who had known him. And
here was his father alive, a man whom all who knew him
blessed. No longer any need to ask if it were not possible to
find some little good in all his father’s deeds; Guest the One-eyed
was a man whose good deeds were told on every side.
This was his father; one whom the whole country blessed and
revered for his Christian spirit and unselfish life. A man
who left with all some kindly memory of every meeting; one
who knew better than all his fellows how to bring out the good
in every man. However terribly he might have sinned, it had
been more than atoned for in those twenty years of humility
and self-sacrifice. Surely the life of Guest the One-eyed
was enough to expiate all.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Ørlygur thought, as he wept in his father’s arms, and
his heart trembled to think how wonderful were the ways
of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the old man shivered and sank down, unable to
stand. They helped him to a seat on the stone, supporting
him tenderly. His body shook with a convulsive fit of coughing;
his mouth filled with blood, and he smiled as he saw
what it was.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and Ørlygur carried him into the house, Kata and
Alma following behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as they had laid him on the bed, Ormarr left the
room, saying he would return directly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>He went into the large dining-room, where his wife was
still busy with supper for the workers. A girl who was
helping her left the room as he entered; Ormarr closed the
door behind her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa glanced at him, laid down the things she was holding,
and sat down on a chest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, Ormarr?” she asked in a low, anxious voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr opened his lips to speak, but could not. He took
her hand and sat stroking her hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This,” he said at last. “Guest the One-eyed has come.
And he is ill—very ill—I fear he is dying.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dying—oh, what can we do? What is it? Can we get
a doctor to help?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa had risen to her feet as she spoke, but something in
Ormarr’s look checked her, and she sat down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr’s voice was hardly recognizable as he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is more. Guest the One-eyed is&nbsp;... is my brother&nbsp;... Ketill....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ketill! Alive?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He lives,” said Runa, as if to herself. “Thank God—thank
God for that!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You—you are glad of that,” said Ormarr eagerly. Then
he turned away. “He is here,” he went on, “and dying.
I have forgiven him—and Alma&nbsp;... she was stroking his
hair....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Alma?” repeated Runa, deeply moved. “Oh&nbsp;... and
that is Guest the One-eyed. No wonder that he never came
here before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr sat down beside his wife, then rose again. “Shall
we&nbsp;... will you come and see him?” he said. “We have
put him to bed in the little room.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Runa. “Do you think he will die?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only death may bring him peace. It has been a weary
way for him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They entered the room together. Ketill lay very still,
and the others were careful not to disturb him. He opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>his eyes as they approached, and at sight of Runa he covered
his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>She bent over him, and kissed his forehead gently. Then,
sitting down at the bedside, she said in a calm, soft voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at me, Ketill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laid her hands on his and said again:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at me, Ketill. It is all forgiven.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But he kept his face turned from her, and only muttered,
sadly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“How could you ever forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at me, Ketill, and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he looked up into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is true,” he said. “Love—only love and kindness
there. You have forgiven me—thank you for that, Runa.
Heaven bless you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He lay still for a while, and his breathing seemed easier.
Then suddenly he raised his head and looked round.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing left now but to die,” he said. “I can see it is
getting dark already. Let me see it to the end—the end of
the day; the twilight and dear faces round me. I shall not
see tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do not talk,” said Runa gently. “Do not tire yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me talk,” he answered, with a smile. “My tongue
will not have long to talk at all; it will last me the little that
is left. Perhaps it might speak some little word that would
live in memory—if only that might be. My friends, do not
think I fear to die—that I would put it off a single second
if I could. It would be good to live with you, but there is
more than that to think of. Only death can make atonement
complete—and blessed be death for that it does. Forgive me
for my words—I would not hurt you, any one, or make light
of your goodness—you, who have forgiven me. But it is
true that only death can give me peace and forgiveness of
all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked from one to another of those standing round.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Friends—beautiful faces,” he went on. “And I can see
the souls of all through your eyes, and all your thoughts.
My heart bleeds for all the pain and sorrowing that I who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>was Sera Ketill left to you. Even you, my son, young as
you are, have found suffering already in life. Shall I tell
you what I read in your eyes now? Sorrow—sorrow that you
cannot feel all regret now that your father is to die. Do not
grieve that I tell you, Ørlygur; your thoughts are the clean,
good thoughts of a child, and I love them. There is more in
your mind too. I know what it means to you to learn now
that your father did not die as you thought—a suicide. But
Sera Ketill died then, only a Guest on earth remained behind.
And there is one thing more, that you yourself perhaps would
not have said before so many—you are thinking of the girl
you have chosen, and how she, too, will be glad to hear what
you have learned today. Come here to me, Ørlygur, and
take my blessing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur rose, and the tears he had been trying bravely
to repress flowed freely now. He fell on his knees beside the
bed, and hid his face in the coverlet. The old man laid his
hand on his son’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Best that it should be said,” he went on. “And you
may be glad of your choice. Her heart is pure, as yours
is. And she will be faithful—as you. Clean and pure in
heart....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He broke off, weeping.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Clean and pure in heart,” he murmured brokenly. “Oh,
that I had been so&nbsp;... that I had been....”</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice was lost, and for some time he could not speak.
Then with an effort he controlled himself, and spoke again:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing done can be undone. By the grace of God it
may seem that wrong has been atoned for and forgiven. I
do not know whether I have atoned for my sins, or whether
they can ever be wiped out. Ormarr, you are wondering
yourself now how it can be that the hatred of me that still
glowed for a moment in your eyes when you found me before
has vanished so suddenly. Shall I tell you why it was? It
was because you saw and understood how I had suffered—suffered
the pains of hell, more than a man can bear. And
because you had suffered too. In suffering all hearts meet;
more than all, when death and the ties of blood are there to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>help. And you, Runa, you are thanking God that I am still
alive, and that I have suffered as I have. Never a doubt
in your heart but that God has forgiven me. And so you,
too, have forgiven. Kata, you and I can read each other’s
thoughts; our thoughts are one. And though you know it
before I speak, let me say it; it is you I have to thank most
of all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was silent for a moment, turned over on his side, and
went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the moment when it was in my mind to throw myself
into the sea—I had thought to drown myself in my despair—I
remembered you. I had often thought of you, and
guessed something of the sorrow at your heart, though you
never let it be seen. I knew your story—knew that one had
deceived you, and that you could not forget. I saw how you
went about as a blessing to others, though you suffered more
than all the rest. And it seemed to me that perhaps your life
was, after all, the greatest thing—greater than all else, to
put self aside and live for others. And it was then I felt
the desire to try if I could not wipe away my sin—try to
spread blessings around me instead of despair. And so I
fled away to a distant part, hiding at night and travelling
by day. ‘Guest’ I called myself, and was the poorest of men,
a beggar, a wanderer, living by the grace of God and man,
eating with the dogs, and sleeping at night in barns or sheds
among the cattle. And I had not wandered long before
I found enough for me to do. Wherever I came, I found
strife and malice and envy and misunderstanding among
those who should have lived together in love. And I took
upon me to work for reconciliation between my fellow-men—with
one another, and with life and death. For men
forget that life is but a speck in the vastness of space without
end; that life comes from death and moves towards
death in a narrow circle. And so they fight to the death,
and seek to wound their fellows, ay, and strew poison in
their wounds, forgetting that every hurt a man deals his
fellow burns deepest in his own heart. With hands thirsting
for blood and souls afire with hate they fight one against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>another—as they had fought for generations. And the
priests—the servants of God? Why do they not go out
among the people, speaking to each, and trying to link the
souls of all together in brotherly love? Instead of standing
up like idols aloof in their pulpits, and delivering the
word of God as an oracle. <em>That</em> is the only priesthood that
is worthy of its name, the only way to show forth God’s
word so that it shall be felt and understood and live in the
soul itself. I could have won many a man to leave his home
and follow me—to leave his father and mother, his wife, and
go with me. But how many are ripe for such a task? And
it was not for that I had set out upon my way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The fever increased. He lay bathed in perspiration, and
his eyes glittered more brightly than before. The others
gathered closer round him, trying to calm him, begging him
not to tire himself with talking, but he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now that I am to go, my greatest sorrow is that there
is none to take up my poor work. For what is the work
of one man? Oh, if there were enough; if there were many
who could understand that the greatest of all is to put aside
self and bring peace on earth. That the greatest joy of all
is to be a poor man, going from place to place and showing
others the way to free their hearts from the yoke of
worldly things. But the priests—they have taken office
and would keep it; they are paid for their work in money,
and grasp at it; they seek a higher and a higher place in
worldly things, for their heart is set on worldly gain—not
with their people, not with their God. It is much to ask.
I know—too much to ask of any in these days. But it is
because none will give it that hatred and dissension live
and grow. I do not know—forgive me that I say this—I
do not <em>know</em> if there is any God, but I believe and hope it.
If I should say I know, it would be a lie. But I do know
that there is more happiness in peace than in a divided mind.
I know that enmity makes the heart evil, and that friendship
makes it good. And I know that our life is made
richer by love and goodness; easier to bear, more natural.
Where all is hatred and strife, who can find any meaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>in life at all? The only thing that helps us to understand
life at all is our own striving for the best in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The room grew darker. As the sick man spoke his last
words, the daylight faded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Light,” he said. “The darkness will be long enough
when it comes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A candle was lighted and placed beside the bed. Silence
filled the room, broken only by the old man’s heavy breathing.
Those around him were busy each with his own
thoughts. Alma sat on the sofa, and had apparently lapsed
into her usual state of semi-consciousness, from which the
arrival of the wanderer had roused her for a moment. It
grew dark and the light was lit, but she did not heed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the old man whispered faintly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Help me off with my clothes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Runa and Ormarr did so; tears came to their eyes at the
sight of his miserable rags. Ørlygur sat apart, his face swollen
with weeping. Ketill smiled as the cold sheets touched
his body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly his expression changed to one of earnest thought.
And after a little while he asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“If—if Alma would come and sit beside me here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Danish Lady roused herself a little as they helped her
to the bedside; she took the sick man’s hands in hers and
stroked them. Then after a little while she sank back into
helplessness again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ketill lay with a smile on his face. Once he tried to lift
his head, but could not.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only a little while now,” he said. Then, glancing
towards old Kata, he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lay her hands on my lips, that I may kiss them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Kata did so.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forgive me,” he murmured, as he kissed the limp hands
of her who had been his wife. “And good-bye for a little
while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is time now,” he said faintly—“time to say good-bye
to all.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>One after another bent over him, kissed his forehead, and
received the touch of his lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur came last. He threw himself down sobbing on
the bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My son—my son,” the old man whispered. Then his face
seemed to harden, and he lay as if unconscious. After a
while he looked up again, and seemed trying to speak.
Faintly at first, then in a stronger voice, he spoke once more:</p>

<p class='c004'>“God—God—my God!...”</p>

<p class='c004'>His hands twitched feebly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you still there? Have they all gone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>His hands dropped limply to his sides. Those near him
touched his fingers, but could not speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can feel you are with me still. But I cannot move
my hands. Is this death?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He breathed with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly, with his old, powerful voice, he cried aloud:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Alma, Alma!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He raised himself up in bed and then fell back. Guest
the One-eyed—a Guest on earth for twenty weary years—was
no more. And Sera Ketill, priest, had won the peace
he sought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those who watched and understood had eyes only for the
man there on the bed. None noticed the Danish Lady.</p>

<p class='c004'>When her name was called, Alma clutched at her heart.
Now she sat still, looking vaguely round. Then, rising, she
asked in a new voice that made the others start.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where am I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>And, flushing slightly, she went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was Ketill’s voice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She pressed her hands to her breast once more, and sank
down. Her heart had ceased to beat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her sudden, unexpected death came with a shock to the
others, and they stopped weeping. For a moment all stood
as if turned to stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then they lifted her up and laid her on the bed beside her
husband. And all knelt beside the bed in silent prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>The candle flickered in the dark, throwing a restless gleam
on the pale faces of the dead. The darkness seemed creeping
in to cover them.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a little all was deathly still.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then old Kata rose and opened a window—“to let the
souls pass out.” And, going over to the others, she knelt
with them beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the light went out in the draught, and darkness closed
about the living and the dead.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>A pale face showed behind a window in a dimly
lighted room. The features were young, but sharply
marked, and the eyes had a strange, far-away look.
It was as if they were peering into life from within the
portals of death, or as if searching into the great unknown,
striving to fathom the hereafter, longing for peace, praying
for peace, yet finding none. Finding only a growing unrest,
a torturing uncertainty that grew and grew, an ever-increasing
agony of longing.</p>

<p class='c004'>That is what the night saw.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the eyes behind the window looked out over the landscape
that lay spread before them in shadowy billows under
the dark autumn sky, seeking to recognize something here
and there. That way should be a homestead; it was there
in the daylight; surely it should be visible now. But the
eyes looked in vain; the gazer found himself at last imagining
that the great expanse of shadow was that of a cloud on
which he sailed across the sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a sort of comfort in thus letting imagination
run its course. Yet unconsciously he pressed his foot to the
floor, as if to make sure of being still on earth. Up in the
whirling ocean of space there was no lasting foothold anywhere.
And yet it was a pleasant fancy—to be sailing
through the sky. Clouds were things that came and went,
and melted into space under the rays of the sun. When
this particular cloud on which he rode should end, and he
himself be hurled through space, where would he land?
Would he land anywhere at all?</p>

<p class='c004'>He expected to see the dark shadow change its shape, but
in vain. This was a check; the sameness of the outlook
irritated him. Evidently both he and his cloud were shamefully
dull, that they could not move better than this.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>And he looked up towards the heavens, as if to call the
attention of his lazy cloud to its swifter-moving fellows above.</p>

<p class='c004'>No sooner had he done so, however, than his flight of fancy
was forgotten. There were the stars—and they fascinated
him in turn.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grey clouds spread their net across the heavens, drifting
rapidly from west to east, hiding and revealing the twinkling
stars as they raced by.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly it seemed to him as if the clouds were standing
still, and the stars themselves moved across the sky, crawling
hurriedly over the meshes of the cloudy net, showing clear
in a blue space one moment and vanishing the next.</p>

<p class='c004'>So intently did he follow the fancied movement of the
stars that in a little time his eyes were dazzled; it seemed
as if he himself had been drawn into a dance of stars.</p>

<p class='c004'>He closed his eyes. And, as he did so, sank into oblivion,
with a disturbed yet sorely needed rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was only for a moment. Abruptly he again became
conscious of his surroundings. His vision returned from its
wild wanderings, and crept, as it were, behind him—he saw
himself—a pale face behind the window in a dimly lighted
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sight came as a shock; grim reality had taken the
place of fancy now. And a sensation of horror came over
him—he started back from the window as if he had seen
a ghost.</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes fell upon the two open coffins, with their white
draperies, that seemed to take shape as he watched them—the
shape of what lay within. The dim light of the tapers
helped to bring him back to the present, and even the weight
of grief that came with it brought in its train a restfulness
of its own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Silently he crossed the room and sat down at the foot of
the coffins, gazing at them till the white of the wrappings
pained his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, bending forward, he fell into a fit of sobbing. A
sense of utter helplessness came over him; soul and sense
were dulled.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Someone was scraping cautiously at the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sprang from his seat, and fear gripped his heart
once more. He rubbed his eyes, realizing that he
had been asleep, and stared round him to see what had
wakened him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The noise was renewed, this time with a subdued whine.
He grew calmer now, and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>A pair of brown eyes and the sharp nose of a dog appeared
in the gloom of the passage. The animal looked up at him
pleadingly, waiting for leave to enter. And once inside,
it stopped still.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur seated himself once more by the coffins, taking no
heed of the dog. He had forgotten it. For the moment he
was occupied wholly with a sense of dissatisfaction with himself;
time after time that night he had allowed himself to
be taken by surprise. First, he had let fancy run riot in
his brain; then, on coming to himself, he had given way to
a sense of fear; sleep had overcome him, and on waking he
had allowed himself to give way to fear again. He knew
there was nothing to fear; he was no coward—it was only
when taken by surprise....</p>

<p class='c004'>Involuntarily he glanced towards the door, where the dog
had lain down. A pair of bright, watchful eyes met his,
and the thought flashed through his mind that no human
being could be more faithful than this dog. He beckoned
it to him, and the animal promptly obeyed. It crept up close
to him and laid its head upon his knees, licking his hand
affectionately.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment he enjoyed the kindly touch. Then his
thoughts went wandering again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can never be happy again,” he thought to himself. “I
cannot understand how any one can be happy now. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>pleasure is there in anything? Everything dies at last.
Eternity—the everlasting—it is terrible to think of. And
all one’s life but a drop in the ocean—what does it matter if
we live or die? And our joys and sorrows—what are they,
after all? All becomes insignificant. Some are glad when
the sun shines; others are glad without knowing why. It is
simple foolishness. Have they never seen a man die? Do
they forget that one day they, too, must die?—die and
rot&nbsp;...”</p>

<p class='c004'>The tears flowed down his cheeks, but he did not move;
his features were set as though already stiffening in death.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Die and rot in the grave....”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he breathed softly, as if breathing in the air of death
in the room, while the tears still flowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he closed his eyes, and pictured himself dead and
rotting—his flesh pale and bloodless—turning green and
ghastly—falling from the bones, hanging in strips from the
fingers and stripping like a mask from the face to bare the
clenched, grinning teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'>He opened his eyes with a start; an icy shiver passed
through him, and he clenched his hands. But he did not
move from his seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God in heaven,” he thought, “I am going mad!”</p>

<p class='c004'>His tears ceased to flow. And in a moment he was cool and
collected once more. It was as if the trouble had passed
from him, leaving only a deep earnestness.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in unconscious effort to protect himself his thoughts
turned towards the woman he loved.</p>

<p class='c004'>He saw her now, in his mind; her lovely figure, her masses
of golden hair, her bright, smiling face, and her eyes, that
spoke so eloquently when they met his. Involuntarily he
smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>But no sooner was he conscious of having smiled than the
joy was gone, and his face relapsed into the same cold, sad
look.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If she had never seen me,” he thought. “If she had
lived far away, or in some other time—then her eyes would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>have smiled at the sight of another as they do now for me.
What is it all worth after all? An accident—a casual chance.
Or could it be that, even if both she and I had been different,
we should have loved each other still?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tears came to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can never be happy,” he thought again. “Once I was
always happy; always sure that the future would bring joy,
more joy&nbsp;... and I never dreamed but that it was good and
happy to live. Now I am changed. I cannot understand it
all. Everything seems different—even my thoughts are new
to me. All changed&nbsp;... I am like a stranger to myself.
And why—what is the cause of it all? Because my father
that I believed to be dead comes home alive—and dies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat staring before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more he surveyed the varied phases through which
he had passed from the time when ten days before he had
first come upon Guest the One-eyed in the mountains—not
knowing then that the wise and kindly wanderer, beloved
of all, was no other than his father, the hated Sera Ketill,
who had disappeared twenty years back, and was looked on
as dead—from that first meeting until now, when he sat
keeping watch over two corpses; that of the beggar who had
been twenty years on pilgrimage to expiate his sins, and that
of his wife, the Danish Lady at Hof, who during those twenty
years had paid the penalty of her husband’s crimes, only to
forgive him at the last and follow him on his last long journey
across the river of Death.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a week now since the two had died. And they were
to be buried next day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur had begged and received permission to watch over
them on this their last night on earth. It had been his great
desire to keep that vigil alone, for he hoped that the night
would bring him some revelation of himself; his feelings,
his strength, his will.</p>

<p class='c004'>The succession of unexpected happenings, the complete
revolution in his inner and outer life, had left him in a state
of vague unrest, a prey to dreams and longings hitherto unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>to him. A strange and mysterious power seemed
hovering over him, possessing him completely. All life
seemed changed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The desire for common worldly pleasures and success, the
thought of being looked up to by his fellow-men—all seemed
empty and meaningless now—or even sinful.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dying words of Guest the One-eyed had burnt themselves
into his heart, filling him with remorse and spiritual
unrest. What was it he had said about a successor—one to
carry on his work—to show his fellows that the greatest joy
in life was a pilgrimage in poverty and humility, setting
aside all worldly things?...</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur could not forget—the dying man’s voice; his intonation
remained firmly impressed on his mind; he saw again
the look of sadness on the wrinkled face as the wanderer lay
back on his pillow.</p>

<p class='c004'>And to him, the son of the aged pilgrim, it was as the
opening of a new world of thought. He had promised himself
to take up the task, to continue the work his father had
begun, without a thought of the difficulties that might lie in
his way.</p>

<p class='c004'>As long as the undertaking remained as but an inward
emotion, a consciousness of his intention, burning within him
like a sacred flame that consumed all gloomy doubts, so long
did he feel himself uplifted in soul, raised far above to a
height where his bereavement itself seemed but a little thing.
He almost felt that in thus bowing to his father’s will and
vowing to accomplish his desire, he had saved the weary
pilgrim from the horror of death.</p>

<p class='c004'>And for a while the difficulties of realization never crossed
his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>At times he did remember that he was a lover. But the
self-reproach with which he realized that he had for a time
forgotten his love passed off again: a momentary remembrance,
no more.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the first days of this his new passion he was as
one entranced, lifted above himself in a fervour of resolve.
His soul was possessed by one thought, by a mighty dazzling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>dream. A glorious ray of golden light streamed into his
mind, to the exclusion of all else. His soul answered to but
one note—the mighty theme of self-sacrifice that rang through
it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Intoxicated with joy, he passed the long nights without
sleep. At first the new, strange exultation more than outweighed
the physical strain, and the grey days that came and
went seemed bright and beautiful. He had never known what
it was to suffer from sleeplessness; nights without sleep
seemed now but an added treasure, an extended scope for
happy consciousness. But soon the climax came, and his feast
of dreams was at an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>The days lost their beauty. He was weary and irritable
from the moment he rose; he longed for night to come, for
peace and solitude in which to dream again. But when night
came and he sought to gather up once more the threads
of his imaginings, his brain was dull, and his mind refused
to frame new thoughts. At first he tried to content himself
with merely recalling what he had dreamed before. It satisfied
him for a while, but a repetition showed the things once
glorious as dull and faded; he could hardly understand how
he had ever been so moved by what now seemed vague and
distant. And with sorrow in his heart, as for something lost,
he fell asleep. Next day he resolved to watch the last night
by the dead, and had obtained his wish to keep the vigil alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had not dawned upon him that he had already been
defeated—that the life he had resolved upon was a thing
foreign to him, with no root in his soul, an abrupt departure
from his natural bent and his former ways. He did not
know that suffering was a gift of Fate, granted to many,
yet to few in such extent that they are able to forget their
own good and ill, and live for others wholly. He did not
know that it is only the chosen of Sorrow who are freed from
all thought of self.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even had he grasped the truth, it would not have helped
him to relinquish his ideas and admit they were but weavings
of an over-sensitive mind. His nature was too stubborn to
give in without a bitter struggle.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>And his doubts did not come openly to begin with, but in
disguise; only later, after long uncertainty and pondering,
did they reveal themselves as what they were.</p>

<p class='c004'>Irresolution, following on the tense pitch of excitement,
rendered him distrustful of himself to an unwonted degree.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat now with bowed head, as if listening intently in
a world of silence. And it seemed as if the silence spoke
to him. No natural utterance, this sound that reached his
ears, but an unknown tongue, a passing murmur of something
mysterious—a wave that rose and fell, now loud, now
low.</p>

<p class='c004'>He strove with all his sense to find some meaning—at
times it seemed as if words and sentences were there, but
disconnected, without any purport he could understand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Breathlessly he listened. His brain throbbed; all his
faculties were concentrated in one present effort; this thing
that was being told him now—he must hear it, understand it.
That was all his task. Perhaps it might solve all the riddles
of his questioning—give him a key to life.</p>

<p class='c004'>And suddenly his sub-conscious mind came to his aid,
whispering some lines from a poem by Hjalmar à Bolu. And
in relief he murmured the words to himself, lifting his head
and breathing freely once more:</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The stars in the east grew fainter, till they paled into
nothingness, and the day rose slowly over the hills.</p>

<p class='c004'>The clouds had gone, save for a heavy bank that
hung becalmed in the west. Daylight spread abroad, and the
blue of the sky grew brighter, until it almost lost itself in a
shimmering white.</p>

<p class='c004'>A strangely beautiful morning; the earth seemed aglow
with such delight of day as is only seen when its face is
furrowed by autumn. The heather shone blood-red on the
hillside, as if striving to show the world that its glow was
that of life, and not of death. The waters of fjord and stream
were calm and still as if storm and turbulence were strangers
there. Even the unmown grass of the fields was smiling with
dewdrops on every yellowing stalk and blade reflecting the
bright rays. And over the close-cropped stretches where
the grass had been cut, the dew lay in a glistening carpet.
Not a sound on the stillness of the air, not so much as the
cry of a sheep or the neighing of a horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not till the farm hands were astir, with an opening of
doors and the sound of human voices, was the spell broken,
and the almost unworldly stillness gave place to the work and
life of common day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first to open his door that morning was Ormarr à
Borg. And he remained standing with bowed head close
outside the house. He was not thinking of the world of
nature about him, and paid no heed to the glory of the morning
sun that shone on his white hair and slight, stooping
figure. His features were strained, and the pallor of his
face, the redness of his eyes, showed that he had not slept.
He stood a little while, then folded his thin hands, with
the fingers that were still those of a violinist, bowed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>head, and with closed eyes and compressed lips prayed the
Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he drew himself up, passed his hands over his
face, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strange,” he murmured. “Why should I have done
that now? I have said that prayer aloud in church for years,
and at home with the rest. But I have not said it by myself
since I can remember.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The smile left his face, and he grew serious. “What is
more strange,” he continued, “is that I should feel almost
ashamed of it myself after.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He shook his head. “Are we afraid of ourselves more
than of others?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He raised his head and glanced round, seeking for something
else to occupy his mind. He noticed the beauty of the
day, and felt the peace of it with grateful relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he turned, walked through the passage, and softly
entered the room where the dead lay.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was seated by the coffins, his elbows on his knees
and his face buried in his hands. His dog lay at his feet,
asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Ormarr entered, he looked up; his eyes showed that he
had been sleeping. Ormarr smiled—a strangely gentle smile—but
made no sign of having seen that the boy had slept.
But Ørlygur sprang to his feet, flushing hotly, and answered
only with an inaudible murmur when Ormarr bade him good
morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr stepped quietly across the room and made the
sign of the cross above the bodies. Then, turning to Ørlygur,
he said, with great tenderness:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go in and rest, lad, till it is time to start.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur’s face had paled again; he looked straight in the
other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!” he said. And his tone was so harsh, so defiant,
that Ormarr wondered what could be in his mind. Possibly
the lad was hurt at the proposal coming a moment after he
had awakened from sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not mean to hurt you,” said Ormarr quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“I know,” answered Ørlygur in a gentler tone. “Don’t
misunderstand me. I only meant that—we can always get
all the sleep we need—more than enough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Silently the two men left the room and went out into the
open.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was anxious for a quiet talk with Ørlygur, whose
manner lately had been strange. He had formed his own
opinion as to the reason—but that last defiant “No!” and
the frank, conciliatory tone of the following words seemed
to require some further explanation.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had occurred to Ormarr that, as he had never himself
referred to the girl Snebiorg, Ørlygur might perhaps imagine
he was hostile to any union between them, whereas nothing
could be farther from his mind; had not the boy’s father on
his death-bed given him his blessing? Ormarr was eager to
make his attitude clear in regard to this at least.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they walked, he studied the young man’s face. There
was a strange, far-away look in his eyes that baffled him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had intended to open the matter directly, but somehow
he felt it impossible to do so now. And, fearing lest Ørlygur
should notice his scrutiny, he looked away, and said casually:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The sun has come to warm the graves for them, it
seems.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur glanced up at the sun, and was silent for a moment;
then he answered absently:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. The sun must have been his best friend in life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The old man turned towards him; the tone and manner
in which he had spoken were unusual.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Those in misfortune,” he said softly, “have but few
friends as a rule.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur’s eyes took on the same fixed, determined look
they had shown in the chamber of death a little before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He was not one of those in misfortune,” he answered
steadily, with a dignity beyond his years; “he was more
fortunate than all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr looked at him with his wise old eyes, as if to
read his innermost thoughts. But there was a tremor at
his heart. “This is Faith,” he thought to himself. “Faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>in something that seems sure beyond all doubt. It is the
first time it has come to him in life. If the boy were a
Catholic, now, he would turn monk; he is convinced at
this moment that self-abnegation is the one true way. God
alone knows the workings of his mind, but it is a dangerous
crisis to pass through.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And, looking away from him again, Ormarr pursued his
own train of thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is hardly what one would call of a religious bent.
That is well. It may be only a slight attack; perhaps it will
pass off. After all, he is still a child in many ways. But
he needs some one to help him—and must not know it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled at a sudden thought. “I am glad I caught him
asleep.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They reached the wall of the enclosure, and stopped. Then,
as if he had been thinking of this all the time, Ormarr began:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was something I wanted to say to you. I would
have left it till later, but it is best to get it said. It is something
that concerns you deeply—I mean about the girl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur started slightly; Ormarr detected at once that he
was ill at ease. But he said nothing, and Ormarr went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have said nothing to me about any relationship with
her, and perhaps it is as well. But from what your dear
father said, you love one another, and you yourself are fully
determined to marry her. Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was so taken aback that he was at a loss for a moment.
He felt that there were obstacles in the way, that he
ought to make some objection now. But he could do no
more than stammer out a low-voiced “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was satisfied. He had gained something at once.
And without appearing to have marked the young man’s
hesitation, still less divine its cause, he continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, I don’t see any reason for delay. Once the
matter has been decided, the sooner it is accomplished, the
better. I will confess that at first I was not altogether disposed
to approve of it. You may have noticed that—and
for that reason hesitated to tell me of your intentions. But,
now, I can only say that both your mother and myself are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>looking forward with pleasure to your marriage. It will
be the happiest day of the life that yet remains to us when
we can see you wedded to the woman you love. And as far
as we are concerned, there is nothing to prevent your taking
over the place here in the spring. We are both a little weary,
though we are not so very old. You will understand that
ours has not been a restful life, or a very happy one, and
it will be a double pleasure to see you happily settled. All
that we wish for is to end our days in peace. And so—God
bless you. If our wishes could secure it, Borg should be
once more a home of happiness and peace.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tears rose to Ormarr’s eyes as he spoke, and his hand
trembled as he offered it. He was deeply moved, partly by
memories of the past that rose up in his mind, and also by
the thought that the young man’s happiness depended on the
success of his, Ormarr’s, own stratagem before it was too late.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur grasped the hand held out to him. He wept at
seeing his foster-father’s emotion, and also because he felt
that he was here being forced into something; he was in a way
defeated. But at the same time the picture of Snebiorg rose
to his mind; it seemed almost as if she were there with them.
What was he to do? Sooner or later he must either prove
false to her or to the promise he had silently given by his
father’s death-bed. For the moment he could come to no
decision—he could only weep. His helplessness pained him.
It was terrible to think that he must choose between giving
up his love or betray his promise.</p>

<p class='c004'>He held Ormarr’s hand in his, and strove to speak, but
could say nothing for tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>Say something he must. And at length he stammered out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not now—I cannot. Another time. But not—not this
spring.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He let go the other’s hand, and hurried away, with bowed
head. But the old man stood still, looking after him with
tearful eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor lad,” he murmured. “But—thank God, he loves
her. And that will save him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Thoughtfully Ormarr walked back to the house.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>On leaving Ørlygur, Ormarr went in to see to the
preparations for the funeral. Ørlygur went off to
a corner of the enclosure where he would be out of
sight of the house. There he stood, leaning against the wall,
and looking out over the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>His tears had ceased, and a strange calm crept over him.
“So it was that,” he thought to himself. “It was that
I could not understand. But I see it now. I must choose
between her and—my mission.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The idea involved in this last word made him start.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My mission—but how do I know it is that? Anyhow,
whether or no, it does not matter. I have promised—I have
given my word to one who is now dead—and that my father.
I must either break my word to him, or desert her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gazed thoughtfully up at the mountains.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Those mountains there—how wonderful they are. Peak
after peak rising to heaven, and sweet grassy slopes between.
But loveliest looking down, on to the glassy lakes. Borgarfjall,
with its great masses of rock, rising steeply up towards
the sky. No one has ever set foot there—only the eagles have
ever reached those heights.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The look in his eyes faded, and he stood gazing vacantly
before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Desert her,” he thought to himself. “She who leaned
towards me, and touched my cheek with her own. How could
I think of it! <em>She</em> could never be faithless. How would
she look if she learned?... Oh, the sight would kill me.
Nothing more terrible to see than the eyes of a creature that
has lost what it hoped for and believed in. To see that in
her eyes....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed—a cold, forced laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a coward I am, after all. I can think of leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>her, forsaking her, and breaking promises so sacred that they
could not even be uttered in words. But I dare not even
think of meeting her eyes when she knows. What a cur I
must be—and I—I would go out into the world as an
apostle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is madness. How could I ever bring peace to any soul,
when I start my pilgrimage by robbing her who trusted me
of her heart’s peace?”</p>

<p class='c004'>An evil light showed in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder&nbsp;... would she really suffer so very much after
all?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>He clenched his fists.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I deserve to be whipped! And, in any case, I am
not worthy of <em>her</em> love. It seems I am growing into a rogue.
I dare not look her in the face now. Her eyes—so pure&nbsp;... and her soul, clean and free from any evil thought.
And she—she trusts me—trusts <em>me</em>&nbsp;... it is horrible!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I might go to her, and tell her everything. She would
understand. But—her heart would feel but one thing of it
all—that we must part. And that is all that my heart can
feel now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sighed, but in a moment his face hardened again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is temptation. And I was nearly giving way.
Nearly gave in at the first onset. I am too weak. The first
thing to do is to take some decisive step, to cut off all retreat.
But how?”</p>

<p class='c004'>A thought came suddenly to his mind, and he shuddered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Today—at the graveside. Say it there, say it for all
to hear; swear it&nbsp;... and then I shall be bound for life,
for ever. And then—what then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>His whole body trembled; his teeth chattered; he cried
to God in his agony of doubt. But he felt that his prayer
was not sincere. And with faltering step he made his way
back to the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>A voice within him spoke, urging him earnestly, clearly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do not do it. It is more than you can keep. You may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>say the words, but you will not mean what you say from
your heart. What <em>can</em> you do or say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He would not listen, but he tried in vain to disregard the
voice that would be heard. He staggered like a drunken
man; his strength failed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the first voice died away and another spoke scornfully:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will make a fool of yourself, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stopped suddenly, and turned pale. But only for a
moment. Then he walked on with a firm step.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was vanity,” he murmured. “It was only my
fear of what others would think. Now I know what I have
to do.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The funeral of Guest the One-eyed and the Danish
Lady was to take place at noon.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the time Ørlygur returned to the house to
the setting out of the funeral train, the hours had passed
without his knowing it. Great numbers of people flocked
to the house; all greeted him when they arrived. Some he
greeted in return; others he did not appear to notice at all.
He was strangely absent in his manner, but this was readily
forgiven, as being due to his grief at the sudden loss.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he was called in to bid a last farewell to the mortal
remains before the coffins were closed, he burst into a violent
fit of sobbing. His meditations of the night before on the
emptiness of worldly things, the hopelessness of life, returned
to him vividly. He was conscious, too, that it was not only
the death of these two who had gone that pained him most.
He saw himself as a miserably selfish creature. At such
a time, there should be no place in his heart for other feeling
than sorrow at the double bereavement, and yet in fact he
was only sorry for himself. He despised himself; he felt
that if others could read his heart they would look down on
him in scorn. Their word of sympathy and consolation stung
him; he shrank from the thought of the ceremony to come,
when he would be forced to take part with all these others.</p>

<p class='c004'>Why not bury our dear ones quietly, in some secluded
spot? Why make an exhibition of one’s grief before the
world? In his own case, it was the more intolerable, since
his grief was in reality not for the dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>He heard the lids screwed down, and stood weeping, with
his handkerchief to his eyes. Suddenly he became aware of
a stir in the room, and looked up. People were standing
round with Prayer Books in their hands, turning the pages
to find the hymn that was to be sung.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>The priest, whom he had not noticed before, was there
standing by the coffins, book in hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur again pressed his handkerchief to his eyes. The
priest was speaking, but he paid no heed to what was being
said, and continued to weep silently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then there was a pause, and the bearers prepared to move.
A psalm was to be sung as the coffins were carried out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur dried his eyes and hurried away, all moving aside
respectfully to let him pass. He ground his teeth, and could
hardly refrain from crying out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They should spit on me,” he thought to himself. “It is
no more than I deserve. I am unworthy of their sympathy—I
do not even care for it!” For a moment he felt as if he
must shout the thought aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside the house some one handed him the reins of his
horse; the animal stood there ready saddled. He stood beside
it, one arm thrown over the animal’s neck. The horse
rubbed itself affectionately against him, as if inviting the
customary caress. But he took no heed, and remained standing
motionless. His dog lay at the feet of the horse, and
looked up; the two animals exchanged greetings in their own
way, sniffing at each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>The coffins were to be carried by horses, two to each burden.
The first pair were brought forward, and planks slung between
them. Then a psalm was sung, and the first coffin
fastened in its place.</p>

<p class='c004'>When both were thus secured, the train moved off, the
mourners and followers leading their horses until the psalm
was at an end. Then all mounted, and rode on in silence
towards the vicarage at Hof.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur rode behind the second coffin, gazing out over the
country with tear-stained eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It all looks strange,” he thought to himself. “As if it
were there only for a time. Or is it only myself that am
become a stranger? My mind that has so changed that nothing
in it now can last? It seems so. We see things according
to the mood of our own mind. I seem like a stone set
rolling, knowing nothing of where it will stop.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Not a pleasant thing to be compared with, either. A
rolling stone must needs be on the downward track. Well,
after all, most comparisons have a weakness somewhere. A
stone rolling down from barren mountains to a grassy valley,
where it finds a softer bed, has surely changed for the better.
But my path lies the opposite way. And no one ever knew
a stone roll upward. Only the glowing rock, hurled from
the bowels of the earth by a volcano, comes to a rest in the
mountains after an upward flight. Oh, what nonsense!”
he broke off. “I am not a stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Or, at least, it is only my heart that is of stone,” he went
on bitterly. “Why can I feel no real grief at my loss? Why
is there room in my heart for all these things on such a day
as this? Am I worse than other people, I wonder? I do not
feel unkindly towards any one. Or is it that <em>thinking</em> of
sorrow stifles the real sorrow itself? If <em>she</em> were dead....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned pale at the thought, and tears flowed from his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God in heaven! That would mean death to me—to live
would be impossible. Her body to decay, her golden hair
to be soiled by earth—her eyes lifeless and dull....”</p>

<p class='c004'>His heart beat as if it would burst, and he shivered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Death is disgusting,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he ceased to weep, and a silence seemed to fill him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I cannot bear to think of her as dead,” he thought.
“And yet I have planned to do that which will ruin her life—to
kill her love, and strike her soul the cruellest blow that
any human being can inflict upon another. What a desperate
tangle it all is. Would it not be better for her to die?
Would it not be better if I were to end her life—kill her at
once? Surely it would. But it was not her I was thinking
of. I was only thinking of myself; not of what would be
best for her, but of what would hurt me least. And if it
were better for her to die, then what I am about to do is
a greater crime than if I took her life....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was so deep in thought that he did not observe
the progress of the party until they had reached the churchyard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>and the others dismounted. Only when the coffin in
front, on which his eyes were fixed, was lowered to the ground
did he come to himself and get down from his horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>His last thoughts had almost stunned him; his brain seemed
incapable of normal action. As if in a trance he followed
the coffins into the church, and remained standing with bowed
head while the psalms were sung and the priest delivered his
oration. He noticed nothing of what was passing round him.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a few minutes now they would be at the graveside;
the coffins would be lowered, and then, as was the custom, he
would be expected to say something himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>What should he say? There was no clear idea in his mind—well,
no doubt something would occur to him when the
moment came. What he said did not matter much, as long
as he said something.</p>

<p class='c004'>The coffins were brought out, and the mourners gathered
close round the double grave. Ørlygur stood just behind
the mound of earth that had been thrown up.</p>

<p class='c004'>The coffins were lowered into the earth, the mourners singing
and weeping; the priest cast earth into the grave, and the
last hymn was sung. Mechanically Ørlygur stepped up on
to the mound. He felt that all eyes were upon him—that all
were waiting expectantly for him to speak. He raised his
eyes, and looked round.</p>

<p class='c004'>His gaze fell on a pair of tear-stained blue eyes on the other
side of the grave. There was a look in them almost of fear—an
anxious uncertainty such as he had never before seen
on <em>her</em> face. But no sooner had her eyes met his than her
expression changed, and the strange look vanished.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had never occurred to him that Snebiorg might be at
the funeral; he had not noticed her till now. She had been
among those who joined the party at the church. It was
a shock to him to see her now, so overcome with grief, and
with that look of doubt and fear upon her face—it struck
him to the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>And here he stood, on a mound by the graveside, with
all eyes upon him. All were waiting to hear what he would
say. Speak now he must. He pulled himself together, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>his heart trembled at the thought of what he must say. <em>She</em>
was standing there. Well, she would forgive him, when she
heard it all—heard the confession and the promise from his
own mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked round hesitatingly. His foster-father was looking
at him with a strange expression—a look that made him
lower his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had seen that Ørlygur was about to speak. He
did not know what was in the boy’s mind, but something
told him that what he was about to say must not be said.
He fixed his gaze on the young man’s face with all his inner
power concentrated in his eyes, trying to compel his attention.
Ørlygur was looking at Snebiorg; Ormarr saw him hesitate.
This seemed further proof that there was something which
must be averted. At last Ormarr caught his eye, and Ørlygur
bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Ormarr turned and left the grave. It was a sign
for the gathering to disperse.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the thought which had checked Ørlygur when he met
his foster-father’s gaze was the remembrance of his having
been found sleeping that morning at his vigil by the dead.
With that in his mind, and with that look fixed on his face,
he <em>could</em> not say what he had planned. It was impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood staring down into the grave.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those present thought only that the boy was too deeply
moved to say the words of affectionate farewell he would have
uttered. And all, even the men who had come up to fill in
the grave, moved away and left him to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He seemed as if turned to stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Too late,” he thought. “And now—what am I to do?
Is all to go on as before? That cannot be—I at least am no
longer the same....”</p>

<p class='c004'>And with a sigh he thought of <em>how</em> he had changed not for
the better, but for the worse. He was a coward.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, looking down into the grave, he spoke aloud:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am growing less and less worthy to be called your son.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And to himself he continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you not help me? Why do you not stand by me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>when you see me so weak? Or is it your will that I should
not be aided in this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he remembered how his father on his death-bed
had blessed his union with Snebiorg, and a wave of joy flowed
through his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Father—father!” he cried, with tears in his voice. “Is
that your will? But what of my promise?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>His joy turned to grief at the thought. And so, at issue
with himself, he stood looking down into the grave.</p>

<p class='c004'>The priest came up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does he want now, I wonder?” thought Ørlygur,
watching the approaching figure with indifferent eyes. The
whole air and bearing of this well-fed, self-satisfied priest
were intolerable to him. It was worst of all when he spoke,
with dead words and traditional phrases that meant nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The priest came up to him, and laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My young friend,” he began—he was fifteen years older
than Ørlygur himself—“I can well understand how you must
feel the loss of such a father—a man of rare virtue in this
wicked world. Yet it should be a consolation to you to know
that he died at peace with God.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked at him, thinking still. Here was this man
pouring out a stream of words over him. It was horrible
to hear. “God” in his mouth sounded worse than devil.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We should all remember,” the priest went on, “that however
much we may grieve at losing the dear departed, there
is comfort in the thought that they are beyond the power of
evil—that death is but the gateway to the Kingdom of Glory.
And to these two especially, death must have come as a blessed
deliverance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked at him without speaking. “He thinks he
is much wiser than I,” was his thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The burial of the dead,” went on the priest, “should
really be an occasion for rejoicing. In any case, the dominant
feeling in the hearts of the bereaved should be one of joy at
the thought that those who have left us have passed to their
true home. And be sure that God looks with more approval
on such a thought than on any outburst of uncontrolled grief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>which is really nothing but selfish sorrow for the loss we have
sustained through His will, and rebellion against His decrees.
All is according to the will of God, and we should cheerfully
and gladly bow to His divine pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur let the priest run on. “He is a fool,” he thought.
“He means well, no doubt, but is none the less a fool. This
is one of his stock prescriptions for cases where some formal
consolation has to be delivered. He is a sort of spiritual
quack. When a man loses his father, he pours out a dose
from a bottle—a big bottle, but containing only a very
ordinary mixture. As a student of the human heart, he is
ignorant to a degree. He cannot imagine that a mourner
standing by a grave should have any other feeling than that
of loss. He sees it merely as an ordinary case, calling for the
usual nostrums. And he talks of a wounded heart as if it
were inflammation of the lungs. What does he know of the
range of feeling in a human heart?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The priest went on in the same tone as before. Ørlygur
said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He wants me to say something,” thought Ørlygur. “But
what am I to say? Tell him it is a fine day? I wonder if
he would go away if I did? I wish I could get rid of him
somehow; he tires me. I would rather climb a mountain
than listen to more of this. Look at Borgarfjall there, lofty
and steep. I would sooner climb it to the top than listen
to this priest for half a day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he turned to the man, with a smile, and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here, I’ve thought of something. Some day, when
I have time, I want to climb up to the top of Borgarfjall
there and build a bit of a monument on the top. It’s a fine-looking
mountain, but I don’t like the outline of the top.
Ought to have something there—don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The priest stared at him, dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hardly think any but a bird could get up there,” he
said hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s certainly no place for silly sheep,” retorted
Ørlygur, with a laugh. “Good-day to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he turned and walked away.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>The priest stood looking after him in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, was that intentional rudeness,” he said to himself,
“or has he lost his senses?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was some minutes before he could sufficiently regain his
priestly dignity and composure to leave the churchyard.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men came to fill in the grave, and the mourners flocked
round to lay their wreaths on the mound that covered the
remains of Guest the One-eyed and the Danish Lady.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among them were Ormarr and his wife Runa. Snebiorg
and her mother were also there, but there was no sign of
Ørlygur to be seen. He had met the doctor, a man whom
he liked, and was walking with him a little distance off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and Runa went up to the widow from Bolli and
her daughter, and greeted them kindly, thanking them for
their attendance. They talked for a little of indifferent
matters, and then Ormarr said suddenly to the widow:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should like to have a word with you alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Snebiorg blushed, and remained shyly standing beside
Runa, while Ormarr and her mother went off a little way.
The widow’s face revealed nothing of her feelings, but in
her heart she was keenly aware that what was coming concerned
her daughter’s happiness and her own peace of mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ørlygur seems strange today,” she thought to herself.
“I hope nothing is wrong.” And she strove to repress a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as they were out of hearing of the others, Ormarr
spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not know if you are aware of it,” he said, “but
Ørlygur and Bagga love each other. I have only known it
myself a few days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow nodded, and Ormarr went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I only wished to tell you that my wife and I heartily
approve of their marrying.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow’s face brightened; the wrinkles seemed smoothed
away. Unable to speak, she offered Ormarr a trembling hand.
Ormarr grasped it cordially, and then, putting his arm
through hers, they walked up and down together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I may be frank with you,” Ormarr went on. “We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>known each other for a long time now, and I am sure you
will not be hasty. First of all, I must tell you that Runa
and I were opposed to the idea to begin with. We should
never have attempted to stand in the way of his own wishes,
but we hoped he would give up his intention of marrying
Snebiorg. But my brother, whom we have buried today,
gave his blessing to the union, and from that moment I felt
that my own reasons for opposing it had only been poor and
of minor importance. And now that I have told you this,
I can come to what I chiefly wanted to say. Something has
happened to Ørlygur; what it is I do not know, for he has
not confided in me or in any one else. He is hardly likely to
open his heart to any one on the subject, I think. But I
have an idea as to what is passing in his mind, and I am
anxious about him. Even if he should appear to have
changed his mind with regard to Bagga, I want you to do
your utmost to encourage her and keep her faithful to him,
for I know that in his heart he loves her, and will always
do so. But there is something on his mind at present; he
is in doubt about something; more, I cannot say. You know
he comes of an impulsive race, and if he should now, while
he is young, lose control of his feelings and cease to take
a healthy interest in life, then the family will die out. It
would be a pity. I know that you have suffered, and more
than most. I also have known suffering, and I should be
proud if I could say I had borne my trials as well as you
have yours. If, therefore, your daughter inherits her
mother’s courage and strength, it would be a good thing for
the race. As yet I am not quite clear what we ought to do.
But I wished to let you know my feelings, so that I might
have you on my side. The interests of—our children, I had
nearly said—are at stake. I always regard Ørlygur as my
own son. And it will be a hard struggle, for neither of them,
certainly not Ørlygur, must ever realize that we are taking
any part.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow was calmer now. She looked earnestly at Ormarr’s
face, as if seeking to read his mind. Then she offered
her hand. It was not trembling now.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“You can trust me,” she said. “I do not know what it
is that troubles Ørlygur, and I do not wish to know. It is
enough for me if he continues to feel as he does for Bagga.
But if he should desert her, it would kill her. And if he
kills my daughter, then, as surely as there is a God in heaven,
I will kill him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr started violently. “Woman!” he cried, “God
forgive you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would not have said it—it slipped out,” she went on
apologetically. “Such words must seem strange in the
mouth of an old woman. But I could not help it. You
need have no fear of me; I shall do as you wish. You
can trust me as long as I can feel that you are acting
honestly. You are now, and I believe you will continue
so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I did not know it to be otherwise, I might think
you were my sister,” he said. Then, speaking more
seriously, he continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should have preferred that you did not come back
with us to Borg today. But there are a number of others
coming, and after we have stood here talking so long it
would perhaps excite remark if you were not to come.
Anyhow, to prevent any danger to our plans, it would be
best to keep Ørlygur and Bagga from coming together, at
any rate by themselves—if it can be done quietly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked back to the grave, where Runa and Snebiorg
were waiting. Several others now approached, and the
widow and her daughter were formally invited to accompany
the party home to Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>Horses were then saddled, and they moved off, most of
those remaining taking the road to Borg.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meantime, Ørlygur had left the doctor and was riding
on alone. He was deep in thought, and allowed his
horse to pick its own way at its own pace. All respected
his reserve, and he was left in peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor had joined the party with Ormarr. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>widow and her daughter rode immediately in front, and
Ormarr noted how the doctor’s eyes dwelt on the girl. It
appeared, from something the doctor let fall in conversation,
that he was again in need of a housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was struck by a sudden idea, but shook his head
a moment after.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he thought; “it would be too dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor was a widower, childless, and lived alone at
the trading station, keeping only a girl to look after the
house. And many stories were current as to the doctor
and his housekeepers. Most of them left after a short
time in the house, some of them going out of the country
altogether, after which nothing was heard of them. It
was also said that he drank in secret, and some believed
him to be out of his mind. In any case, it was not a place
for a respectable girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr was thinking hard as he rode along.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She ought to stand the test,” he muttered to himself.
“And who knows—perhaps it might be the very thing.
A chance that might not come again....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He found a pretext for entering into conversation with
the doctor, and, slackening his pace by imperceptible
degrees, managed to fall behind with him, in rear of the
party.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not long before he had elicited from the doctor
the confession that his latest housekeeper had indeed left
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr laughed. “You’ve had quite a number of housekeepers
these last few years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” answered the other. “It is more and more difficult
to find a respectable woman, and what I am to do now,
I do not know. Do without, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope it is not as bad as all that,” said Ormarr.
“The work is not so very hard, I take it, and there are
generally plenty of girls willing enough to take an easy
post. I have an idea, by the way, that the widow there
would like her daughter to go out into the world a little; if
you like, I could speak to her about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>The doctor was profuse in his thanks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then they changed the subject, and, whipping up their
horses, rejoined the rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later in the day Ormarr spoke to the widow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The doctor is in want of a housekeeper,” he said.
“What do you think?—would Snebiorg like to undertake
the work?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bagga—housekeeper at the doctor’s?” she said harshly.
“Never! Never as long as I live!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not?” asked Ormarr quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know well enough what is said about him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True,” Ormarr returned. “I know his weakness where
women are concerned, but I have never heard of his ever
having gone to extremes. He is too soft and good-natured
for that—certainly, he is no rogue. I do not think there is
anything to fear. And you can, of course, rely on your
daughter herself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow was silent a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose I must do as you wish,” she said at length.
“But I shall hold you responsible if any harm comes of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can understand that you do not quite like the idea.
But Ørlygur is on friendly terms with the doctor, and always
looks in there whenever he goes in to the station. And
if the knowledge that the woman he loves is in the doctor’s
house, and the doctor’s own advances, do not spur him to
act on his own behalf, then the case must be worse than I
had thought. I do not think there is any risk, really.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow sighed. She did not quite like the idea of
Bagga being made use of in this fashion, and perhaps exposed
to danger. But Ormarr reassured her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“With God’s help, all will go well,” she said at last, and
gave her consent.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr had no difficulty in arranging details, and it was
settled that Bagga should take over her duties in the
doctor’s house next day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The widow and her daughter rode home that evening
in silence. Each was occupied with her own
thoughts, and would not have found it easy to
share them with the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>The horses knew their way, and, despite the darkness,
the journey was accomplished rapidly and without mishap.
The animals seemed to know that the quicker they went,
the sooner they would be able to rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mother and daughter exchanged only a few trivial remarks
as they unsaddled and turned the horses loose. They
did not even trouble to light up, but went straight to bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had lain in silence for some time, when Bagga’s
voice came suddenly out of the dark:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mother, why must I leave home?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow was at a loss for an answer, and, to escape
the question, pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga fell to weeping softly. It seemed all so senseless
and cruel—why should she leave home when she had no
wish to go? Who could say if these strangers with whom
she was to live would be kind to her or not? It hurt her
to leave home at all—but her mother willed it so.</p>

<p class='c004'>Worse than this was the thought that Ørlygur seemed
changed. There was something in his look and manner
which told her she was not the same in his eyes that she
had been when last they had met—when he had given her
the lamb. Her conscience had been uneasy on that day of
the funeral—it was the funeral of her good friend, Guest
the One-eyed; and yet she had been glad, thinking only
that she would be sure to see Ørlygur again. She had
hoped, too, that he would speak to her—perhaps even take
her hand. But he had only given her a hasty greeting,
and his handshake had been disappointing. She had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>careful herself to leave without bidding him farewell; she
could not bear to take his hand again in that strange way.
Was it because there were others present that he had been
so strange? Or had he ceased to love her? If he could
only know how she suffered, for all her brave attempts to
seem unconcerned, then surely he would at least have given
her one such look as that which had drawn them together
at the first. But perhaps it was only sorrow at his bereavement
that had made him look so unlike himself; perhaps
next time they met all would be well again. Oh, it was
wrong of her to be bitter and think the worst; God might
well punish her for that. And she had sinned in going to
the funeral with any other thought than that of mourning
the loss of Guest the One-eyed.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Bagga argued with herself, and made up her mind at
last that if she bore her trials bravely, then God might
again be merciful and grant her again the joy of feeling
that she and Ørlygur were united in heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>She ceased to weep. Her pure and innocent heart had
found consolation in her simple thoughts. All would surely
be well again. And as her mind dwelt on the remembrance
of her lover, she ceased to see him as he had been today,
and saw only Ørlygur as she had known him—the picture
she had treasured in her heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>At last all conscious thought faded away; she only saw
him—saw his face, his figure; the smile that had made her
so happy, and the look in his eyes that she loved. They
went with her into dreams, and daylight found her with a
serene and happy smile. And when her mother came to
wake her, there was such quiet and innocent peace in the
girl’s face that the old woman’s anxious look changed to a
tearful smile as she whispered to herself:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely she can come to no harm. The Lord would
never let her suffer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And, dressing quietly, lest she should wake her, the
widow stole out to her work.</p>

<p class='c004'>On waking, Bagga noticed at once that her mother was
already up. She got out of bed herself, and, without making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>any attempt to dress, sat down on the bed to think.
Today she was to leave home. At first she half hoped
it was all a dream, but in a moment she realized that it was
the sad truth. And the question which had risen to her
mind the night before came to her now again: Why should
she go? Hitherto, her mother had never said anything about
her going away from home; on the contrary, she had always
felt that her mother would have been sorry to lose her.
And then to decide on this so suddenly.... There must be
some reason for it all—something they had not told her.
She was to go as housekeeper to the doctor, a man she had
never liked. From her first sight of him she had felt an instinctive
aversion to him. His looks, his friendly advances,
repelled her. But if her mother thought it best, that must
be enough. And if her mother did not wish to tell her
the reason for so thinking, there was no more to be
said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She would not ask.</p>

<p class='c004'>Going out, she found her mother had just finished making
the coffee. They talked with some restraint; it seemed
awkward even to talk of little everyday things now. The
widow was evidently distressed herself, and Bagga was on
the verge of tears. From her manner, the mother judged
that Bagga had determined not to ask the reason of her
being sent away from home. This was as well, since it
saved her the necessity of answering awkward questions;
but, on the other hand, it puzzled her to think why her
daughter should have refrained from asking.</p>

<p class='c004'>The few necessary preparations for the journey were
soon made, and a man came up to the house with the horse
Bagga was to ride.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was noticeable that at parting the widow carefully impressed
upon her daughter not to hesitate in telling her all
that happened—to let her know at once, if need be.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be lonely here when you have gone, child,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga burst into tears, but strove bravely to recover herself.
The two women embraced, and the widow walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>beside the horse until they came to the stream. Here they
stopped, and bade each other farewell tenderly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God be with you,” said the mother earnestly. “Trust in
Him, and keep yourself pure in soul and body. And, should
it please Him to call me to Himself, remember that there is
one beside myself who loves you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bagga blushed at her words, and warm joy filled her
heart. Then, with a parting kiss, she touched her horse and
rode across the stream.</p>

<p class='c004'>The widow stood for some minutes waving to her. And
when Bagga turned to look once more, before passing over
the last ridge of hills that would shut out the sight of her
home, her mother stood there still, a grey, forsaken figure
on the autumn landscape. The sight went to her heart.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Ørlygur had left the churchyard with a smile on
his face after his unfriendly remark to the priest
about Borgarfjall and silly sheep. But the smile
soon vanished.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was childish of me,” he reflected. “Whatever
made me say it, I wonder? And now I suppose I shall
have to scramble up there one day, and very likely break
my neck. No need to do it really, of course. But, then,
that would be rather mean again. I seem to be getting
that way of late.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he perceived the doctor standing before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two and two are four,” said the latter, with a gleam
of kindly mischief in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked up at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t be offended,” said the doctor. “But really, you
know, any one could see that a man walking about with such
a scowl on his face was not sorrowing for the dead. Looks
much more as if he were busy with some mathematical problem
or other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur tried to smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How would you like to make the ascent of Borgarfjall?”
he asked jestingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor looked out over the valley, measuring distances
with his eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shouldn’t care about it, to tell the truth,” he answered.
“But if I had to, well, I should provide myself with a bottle
of whisky, and empty it. Then, when the ground began to
move a bit, I should just wait till the part where I stood—or
lay—came uppermost, and the top of Borgarfjall under;
it would be easy enough to just give a heave and roll down
to it. Otherwise, I think I should wait till after death.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“But you don’t believe in any life after death,” said
Ørlygur, smiling.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor’s manner changed abruptly. “I don’t know,”
he said seriously. “Don’t know what I do believe.” Then,
returning to his former mischievous tone, he went on:
“Anyhow, I fancy whisky is a freethinker. And I sometimes
feel the spirit moving me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was smiling no longer. “What is it like to get
drunk?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor looked at him searchingly, then laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it makes you somewhat foolhardy as a rule,” he
said. “And light-hearted, light-headed, and all the rest of
it. Afterwards, it’s apt to be the other way—heavy, you
know, especially about the head. You’ve a charming frankness,
by the way, young man, when it comes to asking delicate
questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why should I not?” said Ørlygur quickly. “Would you
prefer me to pretend I didn’t know you drank?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor was somewhat taken aback. “No,” he said;
“I shouldn’t. Your straightforwardness is one of your best
qualities. You don’t care for whisky, I know. But come
over one day and get drunk on it—it will probably save
you, at any rate for some time, from any risk of going that
way yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I didn’t feel any wish to try,” said Ørlygur. “It just
occurred to me, that was all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked up and down in silence, Ørlygur looking
straight before him, the doctor watching him covertly the
while.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most likely a woman,” he thought to himself. “In
trouble of some sort, that’s clear. And—funny thing, now
I come to think of it, we’ve never heard anything about his
being taken with any one up till now. Anyhow, why he
should be troubled about anything in that line, I can’t make
out. She must be a fool who wouldn’t have him and gladly.
Hearts are a nuisance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He murmured the last words half aloud, and sighed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur glanced at him. “What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“Eh? Only my heart, I said. It’s the whisky’s done it,
you know. And I was thinking of the time when I hadn’t
yet given it the chance to get in and spoil things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor looked him fixedly in the eyes. Ørlygur
stopped, met his gaze, then both lowered their eyes and walked
on. After a little, the doctor spoke again, looking straight
ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re one of the few people I ever trouble to think
of,” he said. “Because I have an idea that you’ve some
sort of friendly feeling for me. Heaven only knows why you
should. Consequently, the least I can do for you is—not
to warn you, but just to point out to you the rocks that upset
my little voyage; then you can go round or steer headlong
into them, just as you please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He changed suddenly to a lighter tone. “I’m no hand
at serious talk. And you’re looking just now as if you’d
just entered Holy orders. I think I’ll go and find some one
more amusing to talk to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He offered his hand, and the grip he gave belied his words.
Ørlygur understood that the other had gone in order to leave
him to himself. And he was grateful.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a while he walked about by himself. Then, noticing
that the others were saddling up, he found his horse, and
rode with the party, but in silence, keeping to himself. He
noticed the priest among the party, and fancied he marked
an unfriendly look in his face. But it did not trouble him.
On reaching home, he let his horse go loose, and wandered
about by himself, leaving Ormarr and Runa to entertain
their guests.</p>

<p class='c004'>All that afternoon he wandered restlessly about, either
keeping to himself or going from group to group, exchanging
brief remarks occasionally with some, answering others with
a word or so, often without being properly aware of
what had been said. All saw that he was troubled and
distrait.</p>

<p class='c004'>He saw that Bagga was among the guests, but she was
not alone, and he made no attempt to speak to her. And
yet, time and again when he lost sight of her for a moment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>he could not rest till he had found her again. It was a
consolation to look at her, to see that she was there.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the widow and her daughter rode away, Ørlygur
took care to be at hand when the horses were saddled. He
hoped Bagga would come up and speak to him. But she
pretended not to notice him, though he was sure she must
have seen him.</p>

<p class='c004'>At that, his misery overcame him, and he went to bed
without saying good-night to any one. But he could not
sleep. He heard the others come up to bed, and could hear
their regular breathing through the thin partition between the
rooms. The idea of sleep irritated him. What was sleep?—a
giving up of the mind to nothingness. A thing unworthy
of human beings. Surely it was the outcome of indifference,
idleness, an evil habit that had grown through generations—a
kind of hereditary vice.</p>

<p class='c004'>He lay long restless, letting his thoughts come and go.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he became aware of a strange sound somewhere in the
house. Music—somewhere a melody seemed filtering through
the air, calling his thoughts back from their wanderings.</p>

<p class='c004'>It must be Ormarr playing. Ørlygur dressed softly and
stole out of the room. As he neared the door of the room
where he had watched the night before with the dead, the
sound grew clearer—it was there Ormarr had chosen to play.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood still and listened.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not know the melody, but its indescribable softness
and melancholy soothed his mind. If Ormarr were playing
for his own consolation, he was also comforting another and
bringing peace to a troubled heart. Ørlygur listened, letting
the music work upon his mind. And gradually he forgot
himself entirely; that which had been himself disappeared,
and there was something else—there was life, a precious thing.
It was worth living for, only to feel this enthralment of the
moment; to realize this harmonious blending of joy and sorrow,
of life and death blending, as it were, into a golden mist,
and melting into eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last notes died away. Ørlygur crept back to his room,
and slept.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>When Ørlygur awoke next morning he felt ill at
ease. The sense of mental balance he had gained
from the music of the night before seemed far
off, and he had difficulty in recalling it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at the same time the feeling of utter despair that he
had felt, especially after his vain attempt to speak at the
graveside, had left him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strange,” he murmured. “But the promise—it seems
now as if it no longer existed, after I failed to utter it then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And he smiled bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was I really so weak?” he thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>He dressed and went out. The sky was overcast, and the
landscape, now deprived of the brightness of the sun, looked
dead and gloomy, as if waiting only for the white wrappings
of the snow to sink into the long frozen sleep of winter.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the first time, Ørlygur felt the approach of winter as
something threatening and to be feared. And involuntarily
his thoughts turned to the spring that lay beyond. His
heart beat fast as he pictured to himself the joy that comes
with spring—the joy of seeing green things spring up out of
the earth, the poor little blossoms of the rocky hills, the flight
of white and many-coloured butterflies, the light nights, and
the clear, smooth water of lakes set free from their murky
covering of ice. He longed for the spring to come, and
longed to share his joy in it with another.</p>

<p class='c004'>His love for Bagga welled up in him like a spring torrent
triumphant over the grip of winter, carrying all before it. It
was this feeling which had been slumbering beneath his
faint-hearted thoughts, and now it rose and swept all else
from his mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did I not speak to her yesterday?” he asked himself,
in bitter self-reproach. “Why did I not go to her when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>stood there weeping by the grave? What madness was it
that made me greet her as if she had been a stranger? And
she saw it—saw I was changed, and that was why she would
not bid me farewell. If only I have not hurt her beyond
healing! How can I ever explain—how can I tell her of this
mysterious power that has overwhelmed me until now? She
would not understand it all—and if I do not tell her all, she
will see that I am keeping something back. It may be that
I have ruined everything—that she can never love me now.
How could I ever dream of carrying on my father’s work?
It was an impulse sent from hell, and changeable and weak
as I am, I let it take possession of me. I, who am so little
able to control myself that I answered with boyish rudeness
when the priest spoke to me—he meant well enough, no
doubt. I can see myself that I am but a fool—how much
more a fool should I appear to others if I were to go out
attempting to teach others the way to peace.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again his thoughts turned to Bagga. He was filled with
a sudden desire to go and see her, now, at once. Yet he did
not move. Something seemed to hold him back.</p>

<p class='c004'>He hated himself for his irresolution and want of firmness.
But there was something he felt he must do before he sought
her; what it was, he knew not.</p>

<p class='c004'>His gaze wandered, as if seeking a solution. And suddenly
his eyes rested on Borgarfjall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was it!” he said to himself. “I told the priest....
But it was only in jest....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood thinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps the priest will remind me of it some day. Or
tell others—and I shall be looked on as a braggart. I could
never bear it. Bagga might try to stop me if I made the
attempt, but if she heard I had vowed to do it and drawn
back she would never think the same of me again. It would
pain her; she would feel ashamed. And that must never be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He decided to act at once. He would climb Borgarfjall
the next day. And the idea of danger crossed his mind;
perhaps he would never see her again.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the mere possibility of this was unendurable—never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>to see her again. It was too dreadful to be a possibility at
all. No; it could not be but that he would come back safely
to her after all.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the more he thought, the more he felt certain of
success. Here at last was something real to grapple with,
something material, and he felt more confident in himself.
No more fighting in the dark against thoughts and fancies,
but a trial of physical strength and endurance.</p>

<p class='c004'>That it was but a caricature of his former lofty project
never once occurred to him—he would hardly have understood
it in that light. His nature was one that craved real
hardships to encounter; he was not of the stuff to fight with
figments of the brain.</p>

<p class='c004'>He would do it. He would start tomorrow. And, meanwhile,
how was he to pass the rest of today?</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he thought of the doctor. A talk with him would
be good medicine to shake off idle fancies. Yes, he would
ride over and see the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this time he saddled his horse without a trace of
hesitation, and rode off to the trading station.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>The doctor was in unusually good spirits when
Ørlygur arrived.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had good reason to be pleased with himself;
not only had he found a housekeeper in place of the last,
who had left him without notice, but he had found the most
beautiful girl in the parish to succeed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>And if ever there was a man who knew how to appreciate
good looks in his housekeeper, it was Jon Hallsson, the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was unaware of the direct cause of his friend’s
good humour, and when the doctor invited him to stay and
sample the new housekeeper’s cooking, he accepted without
ever dreaming—and without asking—who the new housekeeper
might be. The doctor was always changing his folk,
and Ørlygur was not interested in the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you’ve come to try my whisky, why, you couldn’t
have chosen a better time,” said the doctor gaily. “I’m
just in the humour for a bout today—after dinner, that is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have given up the whisky idea,” he said, with a laugh.
“Not only because I don’t really care for it, but it throws
one off one’s balance too easily. No; I have found something
else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh? And what may that be?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mountaineering.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor laughed. “I prefer the whisky,” he said. “It
elevates the mind without moving the body, and the fall is
thus less painful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need to fall at all,” suggested Ørlygur.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you are still thinking of going up Borgarfjall, I should
say there’s every chance of it,” returned the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am,” said Ørlygur. “I am going up tomorrow, to build
that cairn.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>The doctor looked at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely you are not serious?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed, I am,” answered Ørlygur. And with a smile he
added: “I want to get up and look about a little—see something
of the world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only you don’t find yourself seeing something of
another world—one that your friend the priest seems to know
such a lot about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In vain the doctor pointed out the difficulties and dangers
of the project. Ørlygur was accustomed to mountain-climbing,
and was obstinate. He must and would make the ascent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Must,” repeated the doctor. “What nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is simply this—if I don’t do it, I shall have made a
fool of myself in the eyes of that priest. I don’t know how
you would like that as an alternative.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, if that’s the case, I’ve nothing more to say. I’d
rather drink off a bottle of sulphuric acid at once than let that
fool crow over me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, that’s enough,” said Ørlygur. “Let’s talk
of something else. I came over this evening because I wanted
livening up a little.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very nice of you, I’m sure, to credit me with any ability
that way. Suppose we try something to eat for a start.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They went into the dining-room and sat down. A moment
later the door from the kitchen was opened, and Snebiorg
entered with a soup tureen on a tray. At sight of Ørlygur
she stopped, and hesitated. Then she looked down and
blushed, but came forward and set down the soup on the table.
Ørlygur had risen, but said nothing. All the merriment
had vanished from his face, leaving him serious and astonished.
The doctor was looking at the girl, and did not perceive
the change which had come over his guest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My new housekeeper,” he said, still without looking at
Ørlygur. “A beauty, isn’t she? And if my nose doesn’t
deceive me, she knows how to cook.” And he stroked her
arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How dare you touch me!” cried the girl, and, flushing
more hotly than before, she left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Ah, a bit stand-offish, it seems,” said the doctor complacently.
“But none the worse for that.” And he turned
towards his guest.</p>

<p class='c004'>He caught but one glimpse of Ørlygur’s furious face;
next moment a violent blow under the jaw sent him headlong
to the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>He rose slowly, staring in profound astonishment, felt
himself as if to ascertain what damage had been done, and
then appeared perfectly calm once more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good thing I was sitting down,” he said, with a touch
of humour. “Not so far to fall, anyway. Handy with your
fists, young man, I must say. Well, no reason to let the soup
get cold. So you’re taken with her, too—why, so much the
better, then we’re agreed. And seeing we’ve no difference
of opinion on that head, I can’t see why you find it necessary
to knock me down. I’m not a fighting man myself—very
nice to watch, of course, when you’re not in it yourself,
but otherwise.... Why couldn’t you tell me how matters
stood? Your girl, not to be touched, and so on. Much nicer,
you know, between friends, than landing out suddenly like
that. Anyhow, I don’t mind admitting that the—er—hint
was direct enough. Enough for me, at any rate. Peaceable
character, you know, and not as young as I used to be. I’m
not particularly scrupulous as to rights of property in that
sort of goods generally, but seeing it’s you, and we’re friends
in a way—no more to be said. And since you’re determined
on breaking your neck tomorrow, I daresay you’ll forgive
me for hoping you may succeed. If I were in your place,
I’d let a dozen priests think and say what they pleased, as
long as I kept the girl, rather than go ramping off trying to
cut out eagles and all the fowls of the air by clambering
up to places never meant to be reached without wings—unless
she asked you to, of course. If she asked me, I’d do it ten
times over and reckon it cheap at that. I suppose it’s a
secret, though, or your respected foster-father would hardly
have arranged for his daughter-in-law to come here as housekeeper.
Her mother wouldn’t have let her, I know.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“Snebiorg and I are engaged,” answered Ørlygur calmly.
“It is a secret, that is true, known only to ourselves, and
now, of course, to you....” Ørlygur was surprised to find
himself lying with such ease. “But I hope you will keep
it to yourself now you do know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My dear fellow”—the doctor stroked his chin reflectively—“<em>you</em>’ve
no call to be anxious—not in the least. I’m not
likely to gossip about a thing like that. But, Lord, if you
knew how sincerely I hope you may break your neck tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shan’t bear you any grudge for that,” answered
Ørlygur, in the same light tone. “But I’m very much afraid
you’ll be disappointed. I never felt fitter in my life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve no doubt as to your fitness,” answered the doctor,
“after the practical illustration you gave me just now. But
as to getting up there—as long as there’s no sign of wings
sprouting out from your shoulder-blades, I would suggest
that you’re a fool to try it, all the same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well, it’s your own affair.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had finished dinner, and as they rose from the table,
Ørlygur, according to custom, offered his hand to his host.
The doctor grasped it heartily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Excuse me a moment,” he said, and went out into the
kitchen, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Snebiorg was in the kitchen; she had not appeared in the
dining-room after the soup.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to ask your pardon,” he said frankly. “I promise
you it shall not occur again. Until this moment I had no
idea that you were a friend of Ørlygur à Borg. He is a
good friend of mine, and I hope you also will regard me as
a friend.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Snebiorg looked at him at first with some distrust; she
had never liked the man. But there was a certain shyness
in his manner now, and a kindly tenderness in his eyes,
altogether different from his former attitude towards her.
And she could not but feel he was sincere.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>She made no answer, but he noticed the altered look in
her face, and, greatly relieved, he went back to Ørlygur and
led him to the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been out to beg pardon,” he said, offering a box
of cigars. “She’ll be as safe here with me now as with her
mother. And if you think it’s only because you knocked
me down just now, you’re wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know what you’re thinking of,” the doctor went on.
“My promise wouldn’t count for much when I’ve been drinking,
eh? But there’s just a bit of my heart that the whisky
hasn’t altogether spoiled as yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced up at a large picture of his dead wife on the
wall. There were other portraits of her about the room.
And his eyes were moist.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was moved, and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the whisky was brought out, but Ørlygur declined;
the doctor poured out a glass for himself. They sat for a
while in silence, each busy with his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur could not get over his astonishment at meeting
Snebiorg in the doctor’s house, and in particular at the news
that it was Ormarr who had arranged for her to come. It
troubled him, also, that her mother had been willing to let
her come at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly an idea occurred to him—here, perhaps, was the
solution of it all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trying to make me jealous—that must be it. And not
a bad idea. If I had any doubt in my own mind before, this
has certainly made an end.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced at his host, wondering whether he, too, was
in the plot. The doctor seemed to perceive that he was being
scrutinized.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ørlygur,” he said, in a strangely quiet voice, “I wonder
what ever made you care about me at all? I’ve had a feeling
ever since I’ve known you that you had a sort of liking for
me. But, how you ever could, I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked at him a moment, and then glanced away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you want to know,” he said, “it’s not for any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>reason in particular, but several. To begin with, you’re
alway the same to rich and poor.... Indeed, I’ve heard
that you often treat poor people for nothing, and give them
medicines into the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s nothing,” said the doctor, waving his hand
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And, then, you stay in a poor place like this, instead of
finding somewhere where you could make a better position.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mere selfishness on my part,” said the doctor. “My
wife lived here; it was here I met her—here we lived for
the one short year we had together.... Yes, I daresay it
may seem almost blasphemous for me to talk like that, seeing
what every one knows about my life generally. But it’s true,
all the same. That’s why I stay on here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur sat looking straight before him. “It’s just those
trifles—and that one thing you call selfishness that made me
like you,” he said softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both were silent. Then the doctor reached out for his
glass, and emptied it. And, without appearing to address
Ørlygur directly, he went on:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sitting here by myself, I often think how queerly fate
weaves her threads. Something’s happening every moment—things
happening that matter to some one or other. Only,
I’m outside it all; just sit here and look on. Like the carcase
of a fly that the spider Life has left hung up in a corner
of the web.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He poured out a fresh glass, and laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sit here drinking whisky and never move. Never get
any farther. I won’t say my life’s been worse than many
others in the way of troubles. I may feel so at times, but
it’s just weakness on my part. Here I have a comfortable
room to sit in, an arm-chair, and something to drink. And
there’s many that are out in the cold. Possibly I may be
as lonely and unhappy as they. But at least I can live in
something like material comfort. I’m not starving, for instance.
Altogether, I must be a poor sort of fellow not to
be more content than I am, and go steady, instead of sinking
deeper and deeper into drink. Sometimes I’ve thought of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>committing suicide. But when I go over the pros and cons,
it seems better to go on living. I don’t expect death to
bring me anything better. And I suppose I’m doing a certain
amount of good while I’m alive. Though, on the other hand,
I do some harm. Heaven knows why—my nature, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked up suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Getting dark,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Twilight had fallen; already it was hard to distinguish
objects in the room. The two men saw each other’s faces
only as pale spots in the dark. The doctor rose to light the
lamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur rose also.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t trouble. I’m going home now,” he said. “I shall
have to be up early tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor followed him out to his horse, that was loose
in the enclosure. Ørlygur saddled up, and took his leave;
there was a curious, thoughtful expression on his face. A
moment after, he dismounted again, and, handing the reins
to the doctor, who was waiting to see him ride off, he went
into the kitchen, where a light was burning.</p>

<p class='c004'>He closed the door after him as he entered, and looked
into Bagga’s eyes, that were red and swollen with tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you come here?” he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” answered Bagga calmly. “Mother said
I was to come. And I would not disobey her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have told the doctor we are engaged,” he said, in the
same low tones.</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded, as if agreeing it was the natural thing to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Ørlygur’s heart was filled with an endless joy, and
a proud yet gentle smile lit his face. He opened his arms
and drew her to him. For a moment they stood there, held
close in each other’s arms. Then Ørlygur looked into her
eyes and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am going up to the top of Borgarfjall, to build a cairn
there. And then I shall come and fetch you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded again, with the same expression of quiet understanding.
Then their lips met in a long kiss. Ørlygur felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>his head grow dizzy, and it was not till he found himself
galloping away on his horse that he recovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I fail tomorrow,” he thought to himself, “I am a
scoundrel. But I must build that cairn.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And after a while he murmured half aloud, with an air
almost of disappointment:</p>

<p class='c004'>“She didn’t seem in the least impressed—took it as if it
were nothing at all.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Jon Hallsson was standing deep in thought when
Ørlygur dashed out of the kitchen, snatched the reins
out of his hands, and galloped off without a word or
look in farewell.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s in a hurry to go off and break his neck,” he thought,
and added: “I wonder he doesn’t give up that mad idea.
With a girl like that....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he went indoors, hoping that he might remain undisturbed
that night.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Jon Hallsson had settled down to drink in the evening,
he did not like to be called out. But his drinking had
never interfered with his work; some people even went so far
as to say that they would rather have him slightly drunk than
perfectly sober. Strangely enough, despite his weakness in
respect of drink and women, he had never lost the respect
of those about him. He was a clever doctor, and kind to the
poor; he talked straight out, like a man—at times a little
too much so. And so people liked him. After all, it was no
concern of theirs how he lived or what he made of his life.
There was only one man who detested him, and that was the
priest. But the latter was not so popular among his flock
that he could venture to give vent to his feelings beyond an
occasional remark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jon Hallsson was from another part of the country, but
had held his present post for fifteen years. When he had
first come to the place, he had been unmarried, and the district
at Hofsfjordur was regarded as merely a stepping-stone
to a better. He was looked on by his colleagues as a man
who would certainly rise in his profession.</p>

<p class='c004'>Shortly after his arrival, he had married a beautiful young
girl, the daughter of a farmer in the neighbourhood. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>died in childbirth within the year, and the child immediately
after.</p>

<p class='c004'>The blow had crushed him utterly, leaving only a shadow
of his former self. He filled the house with pictures of his
dead wife, and dwelt on them, clinging to memories as a
stricken bird to its nest. But his physical cravings would
not be denied. And he was not strong enough to master
them. Little by little he gave way, and though at times
he realized that he was sinking, he had not power to check
himself. Other young men in his profession rose beyond him,
while he grew more and more hopeless of ever advancing at
all. He was like a pebble in the river of life; once it had
come to a stop, the stream flowed over and past it, wearing
away every projecting corner that could give a hold, until
gradually it became surrounded by other stones, and the
way for further progress was blocked and it sank down to
insignificance in the lowest of the mass.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jon Hallsson lit the lamp and sat down to drink. He
could hear Snebiorg busy in the dining-room, and in a little
while she came in to tell him that his tea was ready.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” he said, and did not move. As she went to the
door, he added: “You need not wait to clear away the
things. Go to bed when you like. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a long time he sat in silence. Then, as was his way
when he had been drinking for some time, he began talking
to himself. It was as if the silence became unendurable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonni,” he said, using the pet name by which his wife
had always called him—“Nonni, my boy, it’s time for bed.
Getting late, and the lamp will want filling soon. And you
don’t like sitting in the dark, do you? And the oil’s down
in the cellar, and you’d go headlong to the bottom if you tried
them. Much as you can do to stand on your legs now. But
there’s a candle....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He emptied his glass and filled it again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My friend, you drink like a fish. Drink a lot too much.
No earthly need for that last glass. Too much whisky ’s
a bad thing anyway. And there’s no need to empty the
bottle each time. There’s a deal left now, but if I’m not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>mistaken you’ll finish it before you turn in tonight. And
then, my boy, you will be drunk. And do all sorts of mad
things. But kindly remember—the door where that girl
sleeps is not to be touched. Not even touch the handle. No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rose with difficulty and took down a large photograph
of his wife.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Best to do it now,” he said. “While you’ve some sense
left. There’s a hammer in the surgery.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stumbled out of the room, and nailed up the picture of
his wife on the door at the foot of the stairs that led to
Snebiorg’s room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ragna,” he said, “keep guard over that door for me,
will you? You know what I am when I’ve had too much.
Do all sorts of mad things. But mustn’t go up there. Not
up there—no. You guard the door, Ragna. Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he stumbled back to his arm-chair and his glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There you are, my boy; now you can carry on for a bit.
Couldn’t get to sleep now anyhow. Not eleven yet. And
there’s lots of things to think of yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took a long drink and laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fount of youth—serves up the same old thoughts as if
they were new. Night after night—chewing the cud of old
thoughts. Nonni, my boy, you’re a ruminating animal. Sad,
isn’t it? Well, what does it matter? Heaps of people do
the same. Chew the cud of their sorrows and joys, and their
trifles, and their love—yes, ha ha, love, of course. Nice word
for something else.... There, now you’re being a beast.
And if you are, you needn’t make out all the world’s the
same. You knew something about love yourself, once&nbsp;...
blubbering, Nonni—whisky going to your eyes, what? Dry
up, do; it won’t make things any better. Can’t stand one
bottle—you’re getting out of form. Well, well, here’s the
last glass for tonight. Not too much soda this time—stiff one
to make you sleep. Only think, if one could drop off to sleep
and out of it all. Well, well, that’ll come too before long,
never fear. Nuisance that you can’t take a light with you
when you go. Nasty to wake up in the dark when you’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>dead. What nonsense—you don’t wake up when you’re dead....
Anyhow, it’s nothing to be afraid of, Nonni, my boy.
Well, off we go—walk steady, now. Those stairs&nbsp;... but
we weren’t going up those stairs.... And why not, I should
like to know? Fine girl there waiting&nbsp;... and the other
young fool, he’ll break his neck&nbsp;... finest girl I’ve set eyes
on for many a long day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He staggered from the room, and out to the staircase door,
where his wife’s picture hung.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What the—good Lord, it’s Ragna! I’m sorry, Ragna—first
time you’ve.... Oh, I remember now. Well, well,
there’s no going that way. No, I shouldn’t have&nbsp;... no....
Good-night, Ragna.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned towards his own room next to the surgery.
“That’s right, Nonni, boy—that’s the way. Leave the girl
alone. Heart? Never mind your heart—nothing to do with
the heart really, you know. Not that sort of thing....
This way, boy. That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went into his own room, and stumbled into bed. For
a long time he lay awake, muttering to himself. At last,
when the candle had burnt down and the room was in darkness,
he gradually lapsed into sleep.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>It was still dark next morning when Ørlygur rose, dressed,
and silently stole out from the house. He took with
him a thirty-foot rope that he had procured the day
before, and some food. Then, taking the well-known path
up to the mountains, he set off through the darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>His dog went with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur was perfectly calm, without a thought for the
perilous nature of his undertaking. He was thinking that
he would first have to reach the highest ledge, and get a
proper view of the peak, before he could see how to manage
the rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>All he had to do for the present was to husband his strength
both physically and mentally, so as to have plenty in reserve
for the final and most difficult part. He was a good walker;
if only he kept his wind and did not strain himself, he would
be fit enough after a short rest for the last climb to the
summit.</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked on steadily, and by daybreak he had reached
the third ridge. He told himself that he had been going
quite slowly; a child could have walked as far in the time.
He could safely try a little faster now, and get as far as
possible in the cool of the morning. Without hastening his
step, he lengthened his stride a little. As he ascended, the
ridges came closer and closer in succession, and he had
reached the seventh when he felt the first rays of the sun.
For a moment he rested, watching the sunrise. Only three
more ridges now, and he would be at the base of the peak.</p>

<p class='c004'>He glanced at the village below. Here and there he could
distinguish people afoot; tiny figures they seemed, viewed
from where he stood. The valley was still in shadow, and
all its colours, except that of the ruddy heather, seemed
dull and vague. Even the surface of the water was grey,
in places almost leaden in hue.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>He waited only a little while and then resumed his steady
climb. At length the stone buttress of the peak rose directly
before him, standing up sheer in places, at others with a
slight slope.</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked along the foot. It was no easy ascent, that
was clear. The vertical rifts in the massive rock offered no
pathway up, and the horizontal clefts and ledges were far
apart, with a distance of some ten to twenty feet between.</p>

<p class='c004'>After some time spent in examining the face of the rock
he was still as far as ever from perceiving any practicable
way. He came to a standstill, with his eyes fixed vacantly
on the rock before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anyhow, it has to be done,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, pulling himself together, he shook off the feeling of
despair that was threatening. He found a sunny spot where
there was a clear trickle of water, and lay down in the
heather.</p>

<p class='c004'>“First something to eat, then a rest, and then another
look round,” he thought to himself. “I can surely find
a way up there somehow.” And, taking out the food he
had brought with him, he began to eat.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was perfectly calm. They would not be anxious about
him at home, even if he were not back till late at night. He
had stated beforehand that he believed some sheep had strayed
far up on to the topmost plateau, and must look for them;
all knew that it would be a lengthy business to get a couple
of obstinate sheep down from the top of the mountain, so
they would not expect him back early.</p>

<p class='c004'>He ate his food without haste, and then lay resting for
half an hour, thinking of anything but the business in hand.
Then, perceiving that he was beginning to feel drowsy, he
sprang up resolutely and walked briskly round the face of
the rock.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You and I have a little matter to settle between us,” he
said gaily, nodding up at the wall of stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>He found he could walk round on three sides; the fourth,
that towards the northward, was too steep, and the loose
sand there rendered it still more difficult to find any foothold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>To try there would mean going down rather than up.
The rock here sloped down from the top of the peak to about
half-way down the side; Ørlygur had thought of coming down
that way, but he realized that in places the angle was too
abrupt; he would inevitably lose his footing and go crashing
down. It was this which had led him to take a rope, thinking
it might be of some assistance here. Twice he walked
round the three sides of the rock. But there was no cleft
anywhere that went right to the top. Already he felt his
courage failing, and, fearing to lose it altogether, he boldly
commenced climbing up the cleft which seemed to lead
farthest up.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before starting, however, he coiled the rope round him
so as to be easily got at if required. Then he began scrambling
up the narrow cleft. It was a difficult path, at times
the cleft seemed to vanish altogether; in other places it
widened out so that it was impossible to keep his footing on
both sides at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dog, finding it could no longer follow, began howling
pitifully. Ørlygur scolded the animal impatiently, but only
succeeded in making matters worse; the dog ran backwards
and forwards along the base, trying to find some way up.
But all its efforts were in vain, and at last it returned to the
bottom of the cleft up which Ørlygur had started, and lay
there, nose in air, and howling miserably, only desisting now
and again to look up at its master with sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur made but slow progress in the ascent. Still, it
was better than he had thought. But more than once, after
passing some particularly awkward spot, he reflected that he
would never be able to get down without the aid of the rope.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was unwilling to think of what he would do if the
cleft now suddenly came to an end; the thought occurred
to him constantly, but he thrust it aside, and went on
steadily. But he knew it could not be for long.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where the cleft was more than usually narrow, he set
his back against one side, and hands and feet against the
other, carefully hoisting himself up and making sure of
his hold with one foot and hand before moving the other.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Where it was wider, or almost disappeared, he clung
tightly to the side, testing the rocky points that jutted out
before trusting his weight to them. At times he had but
just time to get a grip with his hands, when his foothold
gave way. Then, clinging tightly with his fingers, he had
to feel about with his feet for a rest before shifting his grip.
Inch by inch, by the exercise of all his strength and all his
will, he climbed on, until at last he reached a ledge that
allowed him a much-needed rest. He looked down at the
way he had come, but the sight made him dizzy, and he
hastily averted his eyes. It seemed incredible that he should
have come up there; from where he was, the rock seemed
to fall away inwards beneath him. He determined not to
look back again; he felt that if he did so he would never reach
the top. He turned instead to a scrutiny of the way before
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>A cold sweat broke out on him as he realized that the cleft
he had been climbing ran but some ten or twelve feet more,
making perhaps a sixth part of the height.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the ledge, he remembered, continued to the left, in
a series of jutting crags, until it reached another vertical
cleft running right to the top. One thing was clear: it
would be impossible to pass along the ledge with the rope
coiled round his body; the path was far too narrow, and
if the rope should catch on any projecting point he would
be thrown off his balance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another thing was borne in upon him now—that to think
overmuch about the task before him was more dangerous
than all else. Without more ado, he loosened the rope and
let one end fall, fastening the other carefully to the rock on
which he was seated.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where it was possible to get along the ledge, it would
surely be possible to come back the same way, he thought.
It was only in the actual descent that the difficulties were
greater. And if he came to any point that was absolutely
impassable, he could always give it up and return—“Perhaps,”
he added, with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c004'>Little by little he made his way along the ledge, depending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>at times upon the grip of his hands alone, with his body
entirely unsupported. First a firm grip with the one hand
and then a careful search with the other for a fresh hold.
All his thoughts were concentrated upon his hands and
their hold. When at length he had reached the flat rock
that he had been making for, he found himself exhausted
for the moment. He closed his eyes, and allowed his whole
body to relax for a brief respite.</p>

<p class='c004'>It gave him some relief; when he opened his eyes again,
he felt as if he had slept. Once more he recommenced
his perilous way, creeping carefully and with every nerve
strained, to the next projecting rock. This brought him to
the commencement of the upward cleft he had in mind.
The first part was an easy slope, and could be managed
well enough; higher up, however, it grew steeper. Ørlygur
realized that, even if he succeeded in getting up, it would
be almost impossible to get down again. For a moment
he considered whether it would not be better after all to
go back for the rope, but he gave up the idea at once. The
passage along the ledge was one he felt he had not strength
now to repeat. And with the rope round his body it would
mean almost certain disaster to attempt it. Losing no time
in further reflection, he started up the cleft.</p>

<p class='c004'>At first all went well. Then came a stretch of smooth rock
rising straight up on either side. The slightest false move
here would be fatal, and there were some ten or twelve feet
of it to be covered. How he managed it, he never quite knew,
and from this point onwards he moved unconsciously, knowing
nothing of his own progress until he found himself
lying, exhausted and breathless, at the summit. His clothes
were torn, his hands bleeding and bruised, and there was a
cut on one knee. The keen mountain air refreshed him,
and he lay quietly drinking it in before rising to his feet.
He remembered now how he had been on the point of slipping
at that last stretch of smooth rock, and, nerved by fear, had
made a superhuman effort. It had been muscle acting without
brain, for his mind had been a blank at the time. But
it was done now. After that terrible moment, the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>part of the way had been easier, and he had not stopped to
think.</p>

<p class='c004'>After resting for a little, he went to the edge and peered
over. Now that he was here, he felt no sensation of dizziness
as when he had looked down before. But it was evident
beyond doubt that it would be certain death to attempt
to descend by the way he had come.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still, here he was. And down he must get somehow.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was terribly thirsty, and looked around for water.
After some searching he found a tiny spring, clear and
cold as ice. A little moss grew round about it, in beautifully
varying shades of green. He lay down and drank,
rested and drank again, till his thirst was quenched and he
felt himself refreshed. Then he rose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now for that monument!” he cried gaily.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had only his bare hands to work with, and they were
bruised and sore, but there was no lack of material at hand;
rocks of all sorts and sizes lay strewn about. He chose,
first of all, a big flat stone as a foundation, looking first to
see that its position was such as to render the cairn visible
from the valley below, and set to work building up carefully
with suitable pieces. After a couple of hours’ work, the
thing was done—a compact pile of stone, tapering from a
broad base evenly towards the top. On this he placed a
large flat stone spreading out like the brim of a hat, and
above it a smaller one again.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the work was finished, he patted the stone with his
hand, and laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There you are,” he said. “Now, see and stay there as
long as you can, for I doubt if any one will come to set you
up again if you fall.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, putting on his jacket, which he had laid aside for
the work, he commenced to walk round the little platform
which formed the summit of the peak. On three sides the
rock fell away sheer; on the fourth was a steep slope of
loose sand mixed with a soft kind of rock. Here and there
were hard projections of lava and stone. To miss one’s
foothold there would mean rolling down, with the first stop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>some eight hundred feet below. And, likely as not, the
rolling would develop into a series of bouncing leaps, breaking
every bone in one’s body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur noted half-absently that it was no use trying to
get down on this side. Then he sat down and gazed out
over the valley below. The land merged into the horizon
on all sides save the north-east, where the sea showed a
leaden-grey surface, broken in places by white-topped breakers.
To the south were snow-capped hills, that seemed
more like part of the sky than earth, their glittering surface
seeming out of keeping with the dark hues of the
lower land. A bank of fog came gliding in from the sea,
clear of the bottom of the valley and not touching the mountain
heights, making a weird effect. Ørlygur found himself
suddenly looking down from clear air into a sea of
fog two hundred feet below, that hid the valley from view.
He looked down the mountain-side. It seemed far less
formidable now that the fog obscured the greater part.
And he rose with a sudden impulse to try the descent now
while it was less dangerous.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How stupid,” he said to himself a moment later. “Of
course, it is dangerous as ever. Still, I must try it. No
use trying to go down the way I came up; it would be no
better than jumping off the edge. The sandy slope on the
other side is my only chance; I must try to get off it as soon
as I can find a ledge, and take my chance of slipping before
I strike one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took off his shoes and stockings, and removed his coat.
At first he thought of throwing them over on the side where
he had come up, but on second thoughts he refrained. To
look over there now might make him nervous. He left his
things lying where they were.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The stones will be rough, with bare feet,” he reflected.
“But if I get back safely....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Carefully he surveyed the slope, and marked out his path.
Then, lying flat down, he thrust his feet over the edge.
For a fraction of a second he paused, and then the struggle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>commenced. To seek for secure foothold was hopeless; the
only thing was to make the most of such resistance as
the stones offered, and prevent himself from going down too
fast. His eyes could only see where to place his hand; his
feet must be left to feel their way. Every movement had
to be made swiftly, and yet with the utmost care, and,
above all, without losing coolness and self-control.</p>

<p class='c004'>The actual distance to the first ledge was not great; it
was not more than five minutes from starting when he
glanced to the side and found himself level with it. But
it seemed like ages. A little below him, and slightly to one
side, a point of lava jutted out. Possibly it might be loose
and give way at a touch; anyhow, it was all that offered,
and there was no time to waste. Already he could fancy
himself gliding past the ledge, and then....</p>

<p class='c004'>Before he could recall his mind from this dangerous
channel, his body had done all that was needed; he found
himself grasping what proved to be the point of a large
rock. Feeling it would hold, he drew himself up and
threw one arm round it. This steadied him, and gave him
a chance to rest. A few feet to one side was the ledge and
safety. But to reach it across the few intervening feet of
loose ground seemed an impossibility. If he slipped but
an inch or two beyond, it would be hopeless to try and work
up again; he would go sliding down with but little chance
of stopping himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just then he heard his dog barking, but paid little heed.</p>

<p class='c004'>No, there was nothing for it now but to make the attempt.
But there seemed little hope of success.</p>

<p class='c004'>The danger in no way unnerved him; on the contrary, the
confronting of actual difficulty seemed to allure him. He
would try—and then....</p>

<p class='c004'>He closed his eyes and offered up a prayer. It was the
first time he had done so throughout the undertaking. But
the imminent peril of death compelled him, and his lips
stammered out the old words. It was the age-old acknowledgment
of the powers above—a tribute to darkness and the unknown.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>He uttered the words earnestly, but it was none
the less something of a formality. He was prepared to die;
it was only to loosen the last tie that bound him....</p>

<p class='c004'>Before his prayer was ended, he was recalled to the present
in startling wise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hullo, there you are! Hung up nicely, by the look of
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur opened his eyes in astonishment. Jon Hallsson
was there, on the ledge, in his shirt-sleeves, carrying a bag
in his hand. The sweat poured down his face, which was
flushed with unwonted exertion; he was so exhausted that
he could hardly speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks as though the best thing I can do’s to go down
again, and wait for you at the bottom of your beastly mountain.
Though I’m not likely to be much use to you when
you get there. Wish you were safely over here, don’t
you? Well, so do I, but how to get you there’s another
thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve come in the nick of time,” cried Ørlygur merrily.
All thought of death or danger seemed to have vanished.
“But how did you find your way up?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been keeping an eye on the place—ever since this
morning, watching through a telescope. First time I spied
something moving on the top, I thought it must be an
eagle. I hoped all along you’d have more sense. But when
I saw the eagle building castles—sacrificial altars—on the
topmost heights of pig-headed obstinacy, I took it that by
some miracle or other you’d got here after all. So I packed
up some tools and bandages and things, and came out to
deal with a fine crop of fractures. But there’s neither god
nor devil would persuade me to come crawling out to where
you are now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t want you to, I’m sure. Does any one know you’ve
come up here at all?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No sense in telling them that I could see. At least,
not till I’d made sure whether you were mincemeat or
not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you a knife with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>“Sir—you insult me. Didn’t I tell you I’d come out
here prepared for operations generally?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I wish you’d content yourself meantime with
amputating an end of that rope I left hanging down near
where the dog is. About twenty feet. Then, if you’ll make
one end fast where you are, and throw me the other, you’ll
have me safe and sound on the ledge beside you in a moment.
Not that I’m in any hurry to get away from here, really—it’s
quite a comfortable place to rest a bit. But I’ve just discovered
that I’m desperately hungry, and there’s still some
food left in my bag.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t talk nonsense,” retorted the doctor. “Rope, you
say? I can’t get it without climbing up that silly place,
and I’m not an acrobat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, slip down to Borg and fetch another.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Slip, indeed—very kind of you,” snapped the doctor.
And, followed by a merry laugh from Ørlygur, he turned
back towards the cleft where the rope had been left, muttering
curses on all foolhardy boys and this present escapade
in particular.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little later he returned with the rope in his hand. He
seemed even more angry than when he had started.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Risking my neck for your mad pranks,” he grumbled.
“I had to scramble up the rocks to cut it high enough—I
hope you may hang yourself with it some day. Nearly got
hung up myself. And came down with a run, and gave myself
a most abominable bump at the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not say where he was hurt, but when he fancied
Ørlygur was not looking he rubbed himself tenderly behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was but a moment’s work to make the rope fast, throw
out one end to Ørlygur, and draw him slowly in on to the
ledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There! And now, where’s the damage?” asked the
doctor impatiently, by way of welcome.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No damage up to now, thanks. But if you feel put out
about it, I’ll let you take off one leg at the knee for your
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They made their way back to the rock where Ørlygur had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>left his bag. The dog had not moved from the spot, and at
sight of its master sprang towards him, greeting him with
delight, and continued gambolling around, evidently overjoyed
at finding him again.</p>

<p class='c004'>While Ørlygur was eating, the doctor stared up at the
rock and the rest of the rope hanging from the rock above.
After a time he asked:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The cleft seems to end there. I suppose you just flew
the rest of the way?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur explained how he had made his way round the
ledge. “It’s easy enough,” he declared. “You could drive
a caravan round.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why on earth did you leave the rope behind?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I thought it would be more fun to get along hanging
by my arms, with the rest of me in mid-air. Neater,
you understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see. You’re pleased to make a jest of your own infernal
wickedness—for it’s wicked, nothing less, to play the
fool with life and death like that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Ørlygur only laughed and went on with his meal.
The doctor continued his study of the rock, as if imagining
himself making the ascent, and shuddered. Then, abandoning
his ill-humoured tone, he turned to Ørlygur with tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you young fool!” he said. “Can nothing content
you but roads that were meant for the eagles?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going another road tomorrow,” said Ørlygur, with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, don’t count on me this time,” he said. “I’ll not
go dangling at your heels with an ambulance train every
time you’ve a fancy to risk your neck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s not much risk this time—not in that way, at
least. I’m only going over to the station to carry off your
housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that’s what I get for my pains—not to speak of
subsequent complications,” grunted the doctor. It was cool
up there in his shirt-sleeves, and a recent bump made it uncomfortable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>for him to sit down. But there was a note
of relief in his voice as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as Ørlygur had finished eating, they started on
their way down. It was sunshine the first part of the way,
but a little farther down they found themselves enveloped
in a bank of clammy fog. At a distance, Ørlygur’s dog
was magnified to the size of a calf, and well-known rocks
became distorted and unrecognizable. Nevertheless, they
found no difficulty in making their way down. The path
was always just visible, and Ørlygur knew the track so well
that he could have followed it blindfold. As they went on,
the fog became thicker; the doctor’s horse was nowhere to be
seen. They searched for some time without success; they
could hardly see an arm’s length ahead. The saddle had
been left beside the track, and this they discovered, but
the horse was gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve always some horses in the paddock at home at
this time of year,” said Ørlygur. “You can take one of
ours. I’ll find yours tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On arriving at Borg, Ørlygur at once caught one of the
horses wandering loose, and put on the doctor’s saddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll come indoors and have a cup of coffee before
you go on?” he said to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks, I won’t say no. And perhaps a drop of something
stronger wouldn’t be amiss. But catch a couple
more horses while you’re about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor turned his head away, and answered a trifle
sadly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“No need to put off that business you were speaking of
till tomorrow, is there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur looked at him without a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Besides, you’d be company for me on the way home.
I don’t feel like wandering about alone in this fog.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur set off at once after two more horses, and tied
up the three in readiness. Then the two men went indoors,
and Ørlygur ordered coffee.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a while Ormarr came in.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>“What brings you here, doctor?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jon Hallsson made no reply, but glanced at Ørlygur.
Ormarr followed his glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And where have you been, Ørlygur?” he asked, noticing
the boy’s hands and clothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d better go and change, I think,” said Ørlygur awkwardly—“I’ve
been up Borgarfjall,” he added. “Up to
the top.” And he rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr looked from one to the other in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Up Borgarfjall! And you, too, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” answered the doctor, with emphasis. “No climbing
to the top of Borgarfjall for me, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr turned to Ørlygur with a questioning look.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What were you doing up there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought a sort of monument would look nice on top.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sort of monument!...” Ormarr shook his head.
“But the top—the peak—it’s more than any man could do
to get there!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly,” said Ørlygur.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr and the doctor burst out laughing, in which
Ørlygur joined. Then hurriedly he made his escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he had left the room, Ormarr turned to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does it all mean?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My dear Ormarr Ørlygsson, don’t ask me. I have to
thank you, by the way, for finding me a most excellent housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh,” answered Ormarr, somewhat at a loss, “I just happened
to know....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You just happened to know my little weakness,” put in
the doctor angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both men were silent for a moment. Then the doctor
burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never been so done in all my life,” he said in an injured
tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m very sorry,” said Ormarr. “But it was the only
way I could see to....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, never mind. Most happy to reciprocate, if needed,
and all that. But where am I to get another now?”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Ormarr’s face lit up with a sudden gleam of pleasure. He
was about to speak, when the doctor interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, she is,” he said sharply. “It’s all settled. I’ve
played my little part. And Ørlygur’s going off now to
fetch her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr rose, laughing, and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My dear doctor, let me congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Me!” snapped the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, you. A most rapid and satisfactory cure. If I
can help you to find another housekeeper....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, I won’t trouble you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor grasped Ormarr’s hand cordially. “I’m just
as pleased with the result as you can be, really,” he said,
with frank sincerity. “Ørlygur and I are rather friends,
you know. But he is a headstrong young fool, all the same.
You ought to go and look at that place where he went
up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you were with him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not at the time—no. But from something he let fall
last night, and seeing something moving up there today, I
had an idea, and went up to see what he was doing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s all this about a monument?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know. But I fancy he wanted to relieve his
feelings in some way—by doing something out of the ordinary,
you understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr seemed to be thinking hard. Then he looked up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What makes you think so?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s only an idea of mine. He is young, and full of
energy.... But, of course, I may be wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fancy you are right,” said Ormarr. “More so, perhaps,
than you imagine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a pause. Ormarr was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here,” he said. “Let Ørlygur ride over now and
fetch the girl, and you stay here for tonight. We have not
seen much of each other up to now, but you have been a good
friend to my son—my foster-son, that is. There are several
things we two old fellows could find to talk about. Besides,
you must be tired.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>The doctor accepted the invitation, and when Ørlygur
was ready to start, Ormarr went up to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will bring her home here, of course. But I think
you ought to go round by Bolli, and bring her mother as
well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ørlygur answered with a grateful glance and a nod. And
no more was said.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c004'>Ormarr Ørlygsson and Jon Hallsson sat long talking
together. Each sat by a window, watching the little streams
of moisture that trickled down the panes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor seemed weary and in low spirits.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m tired of life myself,” he said. “Have been for
years now. And yet I potter about trying to keep others
alive, when I daresay they’re just as tired of it as I am.
Doesn’t seem much sense in it anyway.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Life is a precious thing,” he said. “And often we
don’t realize it until it is too late. Then we fall to musing
dismally about it, instead of using our experience for the
good of others—for those who are to come after us. We
say to ourselves: I have suffered; so will they. Well, why
not? Let them look after themselves. But why have we
suffered? Because we are narrow-minded and ungrateful.
Surely we have known some glorious moments; how can
we complain of life after? Life is a round of ceaseless change,
day and night, sunshine and rain; we ourselves pass from
the unknown to the unknown again&nbsp;... and that is why
a moment of harmony we call happiness is a wondrous
thing—a thing that can never be paid for throughout all
eternity.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may be right,” said the doctor. “I feel myself an
ungrateful creature at this moment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have only felt that harmony myself at moments when
I was able to forget myself entirely in my music,” Ormarr
went on. “And then it was really only a complete forgetfulness
of all that was passing around me. How much
greater must be the happiness of those who <em>meet</em> in harmony;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>two human beings sharing happiness! For them it is the
rising of a sun that nothing can darken but the grave.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then?” he said. “When the grave had taken one
of them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you wish you had never known the happiness
that has given you the greatest sorrow of your life?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The doctor shook his head. “No! Not if it cost me all
eternity in torture.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you ever thought of it before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said the doctor. “But I see what you mean.
And you are right. It simply comes to this: that we
should be grateful for life—grateful and happy for having
been allowed to live.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ormarr nodded. “Happy and grateful—yes. And humble,
too.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c003'>Ørlygur and Bagga rode quietly through the mist
over the hills from the station to Bolli. There
was no need for haste. They rode side by side,
keeping close together, holding each other’s hands in a
clasp that seemed as if it were never to end.</p>

<p class='c004'>They spoke but little. Each felt, in absence, that there
was so much to say. But, on the surface, they were yet
as strangers to each other in this, that it was not easy to
speak of little trivial things. There was so much that they
had not yet known; and their minds were full of a silent,
happy longing and anticipation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet they rode there together in the mist, as if it were but
natural that they should—as if they already belonged to
each other—were already one heart and one soul.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mist that wrapped them seemed a light and kindly
thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>They did not think how life had played with them but
a few hours back, like pawns in a game, or how the mist
of the present hour was but a pause while life determined
what the next move should be. They rode side by side,
holding each other’s hand. And neither felt the vaguest
glimmer of doubt as to the other’s will—the other’s love.
Both felt that nothing in life could part them now. And
the thought of death was far away.</p>

<p class='c004'>They rode together over the hills, two grey figures in the
mist. But there was sunshine in their souls.</p>
